If you’re feeling overwhelmed, don’t be discouraged. I’ve written this book to help you no matter where you are on the puppy continuum. Adopting a puppy is more like bringing home a baby than, say, a fish or a hamster, but with a child, there’s usually a lot more build-up, with months to mull over magazine articles and room décor. And even the infant stage is pretty tame — not so with puppy. Unlike other pets, puppies bond and engage with you from the minute you meet them, and they depend on you like a child from that day forward. In return for your kindness, they offer you their unconditional love and enthusiasm every day of their lives. Dogs are like toddlers in their adoration and attentiveness, delighting in every interaction and weaving their way into every social interaction that goes on in your household.\n\nPuppies and toddlers have even more similarities: Both are nonverbal and reliant on you. Both depend on you to shape and fulfill their everyday needs, from learning where and what to eat and drink to figuring out where to sleep and go potty. A puppy matures a lot faster than a baby, so that’s a plus (the first year of a puppy’s life equals about 20 of a human’s), but a dog’s emotional capacity paral- lels a 2- or 3-year-old, so they never leave for college, wreck the car, or max out your credit cards!",

This first chapter lays the groundwork for what lies ahead. With these guidelines in hand, you’ll have no trouble getting through the first year.\n\nDogs come in a lot of shapes and sizes. Until now, you may not have given dog breeds and personalities much thought. Instead, you may have believed that the only characteristics separating one pup from another were coat color and body size. Unless your plan is to choose a dog who complements your couch cushions, you have to know a little bit about the types available.\n\nBefore you consider the differences between dog types, in Chapter 2 I help you peek into your lifestyle to get a handle on what it is you want from your relation- ship. Puppyhood is a quick window, lasting about a year, but dogs live a long time (generally, 10 to 14 years, depending on the dog breed or breed mix), so it’s impor- tant to think about your life now as well as 5 to 10 years from now. For example, your heart’s pick may be a high-energy breed from the Sporting group, but if you’re at work most of the day and you prefer “vegging out” to jogging, this puppy will lose their appeal when you find them climbing your walls or curtains.",

A quick peek at the concept of hybrid vigor will help you to appreciate a dog who looks and acts unique. I’ll also help you explore the ideal home environment for different types of dogs as well as the necessary exercise, training, and socialization commitments of each one.\n\nAfter you have an idea of the personality you want, you can consider breeds. Over time, hundreds of known breeds have been developed worldwide. In the United States, the breeds are grouped into seven categories: Herding, Hound, Non- Sporting, Sporting, Terrier, Toy, and Working. Each of these breeds has specific characteristics that allow the dogs to withstand the environment of the lands of their original descent. Each breed has a defined look, temperament, and interest that continues to get passed down from generation to generation.\n\nIn Chapter 4, I show you how to start your search. Talking to various rescue orga- nizations and breeders is a project in and of itself. To help you, I’ve created a list of questions that are important for you to ask — and I also fill you in on the kinds of questions you may be asked as a potential parent to their dog.",

Visualize the ideal characteristics you value in a dog and list them in the margin. For example, do you want a dog who’s devoted to making you happy and who’s needy for attention and delighted to do your bidding? Or are you more comfortable with a puppy who’s affectionate but independent? Maybe your heart is set on a timid puppy who needs patience, coaxing, and love to come out of their shell. Believe it or not, you can make accurate behavioral predictions such as these when puppies are just eight weeks old.\n\nA puppy’s instinctual skills, with a few exceptions, are no longer necessary to human survival. But please don’t let any puppies in on this secret. Their skills are their life’s talent, and employing them gives their lives a sense of purpose. No sheep to herd? The neighborhood kids will do. No snow in Savannah? Pulling a skateboarder will satisfy a Siberian husky. No ducks to retrieve? A tennis ball will do just fine. Dogs love to work, and they can’t quell their passions just because you have a late meeting. So, be sure to take the breed’s job instincts into account when picking a pooch, and always make time to indulge them.\n\nYou’ve been looking forward to bringing your puppy home for days, weeks, and perhaps even years.

Plan ahead by organizing both the trip home and your arrival. Make your puppy- supply purchases, which are listed in Chapter 5, well in advance. Also set up your pup’s room before they come home, and explain your routines to family and friends. Having a plan puts your mind at ease, which will help your puppy survive this transition stage. Your puppy will bond to you and their new life in no time, though the first few days can be jarring for both of you.\n\nThe most important task to focus on in the early months is socializing your puppy to people, places, and normal stimulations. As far as developing good habits early on, your puppy will thrive on consistency and predictability, and so will you. In Chapter 6, I explore the new science of modern dog training and describe what science has proven about living with dogs. Researchers used to scoff at us crazy dog people, reminding us that dogs were incapable of reason and emotion; now those researchers have come full circle. Studies show that puppies and human toddlers have a tremendous amount in common: Now it’s the academics who are telling us that dogs think and feel, and will mature to the capacities of a 3-to- 4-year-old child. This chapter helps frame out just how capable and eager your puppy is for learning and how making the most of puppyhood — by investing in play, socialization, and training — will reward you for a lifetime.",

In a puppy’s mind, kids are often pigeonholed as other puppies and can be perceived as rivals for toys, food, and attention. Chapter 8 offers a proactive (rather than reactive) approach to raising a puppy with children — from phrases to use to groovy games and activities to play. By organizing fun activities, you’re giving the child license to both control and enjoy the puppy while the puppy learns respect for everyone who walks on two legs.\n\nIf you want a well-rounded, gentle-mannered dog, follow this secret tip: Overdo socialization in puppyhood. Go overboard with socialization, even more so than with training. Expose your puppy to everything — objects, surfaces, sounds (inside and out), places, and people of all ages, races, sexes, and sizes. Expose your pup to other animals and pets, too. (Until your puppy is inoculated, surround them with healthy, friendly dogs.) Even changes in weather patterns must include mindful handling. If your puppy is startled or concerned, a soothing reaction from you may be misinterpreted as mutual fear. To teach them how to manage them- selves, reassure your puppy with your confidence and direction. Knowing how to calm them when they’re stressed can make the difference between a pet who rolls with the changes and one who locks up emotionally or reacts defensively.

This is where you get to make a positive impression, shape their personality for the better, and socialize them to sound and daily routines that they’ll discover in your home. They’re needy and dependent on you, so make the most of this time together. Chapter 10 will guide you!\n\n» Teaching Your Pre-Adolescent Puppy (16 weeks to 6 months): Before the terrible twos start, you may be convinced that you’ve adopted an angel. Then it happens almost overnight: Your puppy falls from grace. If it’s any consola- tion, all their mischief is a wonderful sign of normal development. Your puppy is growing up. Most people notice more confidence during this stage and less of a help-me attitude and more of a can-do spirit. Embrace it. Chapter 11 shows you the way!\n\n» Surviving the Teenage Months (6 months to 9 months): Okay, by now\n\nyou’re getting a good glimpse of your puppy’s lifelong personality quirks. Are they needy, confrontational, strong-willed, dependent, focused, obstinate? Your puppy is maturing faster than you can keep up. Now is the time to start fun, positive training routines and to increase games that encourage interac- tion. Fortunately for you, bad habits are easy to phase out during this stage if you can remember to stay cool. Puppies are still eager to please during this stage and are motivated to behave to get what they want — from treats to toys and attention. Chapter 12 tells you what you need to know.",

Anger and frustration will spell your ruin — your puppy won’t understand you, and they’ll react with confusion and, possibly, defensiveness.\n\n» Striving for Off Lead Control (9 to 12 months): At this point, for the most part you can see the light at the end of the dark tunnel. During this phase, if you’ve been consistent with training, you’ll often have a super puppy — devoted, responsive, and mindful. Well, that is to say, most of the time. Sometimes your almost-adult puppy still tests their independence; sometimes that incorrigible 3-month-old puppy reemerges, and they’re up to their old tricks.\n\nDoes committing the next year to train a puppy sound like a project? Well, you’re right — it is. After you commit to the role of your puppy’s parent and teacher, they can learn all they need to know throughout the first year — from where to potty and what to chew to polite greeting manners and how to conduct themselves in a crowd. They won’t learn these things overnight, however — like school for children, puppy training is a stage-by-stage process.\n\nTeaching your puppy commands is similar to teaching English as a second lan- guage. Though your puppy can’t understand sentences or phrases, one spoken word — paired with a posture or routine — will make your puppy feel directed, connected, and safe.\n\nHere are a few of the commands you can find in Chapter 11:\n\n» Follow: This command says, “I’ll lead the way.

A protective breed of any size, bent on alert barking every time some- one ventures near the front door, may not be the best choice if your home is the hub of weekly PTA and after-school get-togethers.\n\nThis questionnaire is split into three subsections to better help you gain perspec- tive on yourself and your choice in selecting a breed or mixed breed. If you’re committed to caring for a puppy and meeting their needs, and if you can muster up the patience to deal with typical puppy phases, you’re certainly on your way to a lovely, lifelong bond with your puppy. Good luck!",

As you read this section, make a mental sketch of your ideal dog. Your answers will help you get some ideas of the type of dog that will suit your lifestyle in the long run. Keep the questionnaire in mind (make a copy if you need to) as I walk you through the description of the various breeds or mixed breeds in Chapter 3.\n\nEven though your dog’s appearance shouldn’t be a chief motivating factor in your breed selection, it’s still important. You may have strong preferences based on aesthetics, such as what tail or facial features make you smile, and you can narrow down the breeds you look at based on those criteria. You may also be concerned with practical matters — what care is involved in owning a curly or thick-coated dog. Questions 1 through 5 guide you along and help you narrow your decision.\n\nCertain features affect the cost of owning a dog, and that consideration may be an important one for you. When you’re considering your dream dog, consider hidden perks and drawbacks tied to the appearance of each individual breed: For example, breeds with nonshedding hair will save you from fur- covered furniture, but they do require regular trips to the groomer. Long-, thick-, or curly-coated dogs also need professional grooming periodically. And you may love the look of bigger dogs, but they cost more to feed than small or tiny dogs.",

Some breeds are fiercely self-contained and independent and need little human direction in order to shape and reinforce their behavior. Other dogs watch you closely and can’t seem to make a decision without weighing your opinion.

Consider your favorite pastime and find a puppy who will grow up to be in the same groove as you. For example, if you’ve got a fetish for Frisbees, you have to decide whether you want a dog who fetches them relentlessly or one who shows no interest (so that you can actually play a civilized game with friends or family). A dog bred to course fields all day herding, hunting, or retrieving waterfowl will grow insanely restless and destructive if they’re cooped inside all day. A companion dog, however, will enjoy the serenity of calm, predictable activities and will need far less exercise to stay on an even keel.\n\n» Question 19: Introducing a new puppy to other pets in your household can\n\nbe tricky, so take this question seriously. If you breed prize-winning rabbits or own cats, avoid breeds genetically programmed to kill them. If you have another dog, choose a breed that will mesh with their traits and personality. Other pets? Even those in glass cages can elicit your dog’s drive to chase and capture. If you have any other pets, consider a breed with a more chilled reaction to other animals.\n\n» Question 20: If you have other considerations, think through them in terms of the future.

The earliest age you bring home a puppy should be eight weeks old, although this should not be the first time your puppy is around people. You will learn a lot about choosing a rescue puppy or breeder in Chapter 4, but for now remember that your puppy should be raised inside and around people and household noises from the moment’s they’re born. You may hear the term impressionable or the even fancier term imprinting, which relates to how often your developed puppy was handled and exposed to different noises and stimulations. Although you may think that your puppy should grow up in a bubble during their early weeks, you would be wrong. Studies show that puppies exposed to the chaos of everyday life and handled by friendly people are better able to adapt to life with you when they come home.\n\nIf you bring home a young-young puppy (younger than 12 weeks of age), they’ll need a lot of socialization, supervision, and consideration. You’ll need to continue to expose them to lots of sights and sounds, bringing them out in a carrying case or on leash after your veterinarian says it’s safe to do so. (More on this adventure in Chapter 9.) Little puppy bladder muscles aren’t fully developed; their teeth are falling out at a rapid pace, they’re unsure of themselves, and, in short, they can be overreactive to everyday occurrences, spelling out hyperexcitement or distress. If the thought of midnight potty runs leaves you feeling cool to the idea of raising a young puppy, perhaps you’d be better suited to adopting an older puppy or dog. Puppies older than four months begin to have better bladder control and are well through their nipping and teething phases, so you may have an easier time with them.",

Find one that has been raised inside a house and around lots of people and other dogs. The first six months of a dog’s life is a critical socialization period, where your dog either grows comfortable of their surroundings or wary of new experiences. If you adopt a little puppy, you have control over this time and can shape your puppy’s life experiences; if you adopt an older puppy, make sure they’ve had the right type of social experiences to fit in with your lifestyle.\n\nAs far as where to go to find an older puppy, start by visiting a local shelter or perusing rescue organizations online through sites such as www.petfinders.com or www.adoptapet.com. Shelters are filled with older puppies and dogs, and you can easily find rescue clubs for specific breeds on the Internet or through a local kennel club. (In the United States, www.AKC.org is a good place to start.) Some- times a breeder may hold on to a puppy longer for various reasons, such as an adopter backed out, the puppy displayed show potential, a puppy is returned, or a puppy is held for medical reasons. If this option sounds promising to you, ask the same essential questions I list in Chapter 4, such as where the puppy was raised during their critical imprinting stage (from birth to four months old) and whether they are housetrained and socialized. Your puppy cannot change their early influ- ences and you do not want to get stuck with a puppy who has spent their whole life in a kennel or living outside.",

Walking, grooming, and feeding your puppy all require a mindfulness that leaves your carefree days in the dust.\n\nIf you’re truly up for the challenge, remember that your puppy will be your responsibility for a decade or more. If you plan to share a household with someone eventually, socialize your puppy well so that they won’t get their hackles up when that special someone sweeps you off your feet. Also, think about whether you may have a family of your own someday. If it seems likely, choose a breed that enjoys children, and start socializing your puppy with kids from the get-go.

Raising a puppy is a lot easier with two people to share the responsibilities, but consistency is a key factor. If the two of you join forces, following similar guidelines for structure and training, your puppy will mature quickly and thrive in the consistency.

However, remember that a young puppy’s needs can be quite demanding. If you already completed the 4 a.m. diaper-changing routine and you’d rather skip these experiences than relive them, consider an older puppy who has been in a supportive environment or one whom the breeder is willing to socialize and train for you. Also, pay close attention to the exercise requirements when choosing a puppy. You need to ensure that you and your soon-to-be-adult dog are a solid match.\n\nIf you’re getting a puppy to raise with your young child, you may suddenly feel like you have twins (except that one is slightly furrier than the other).

This puppy can mature into a dog with an innate fear of young children or into a dog who’s immediately tense in their company.\n\nIf you have a needy toddler, postpone getting a puppy for at least a couple of years. Your child needs all your attention to develop a strong sense of self. A puppy will pull you away from your parental duties and rival the toddler for your attention. This situation is almost guaranteed to cause some headaches. Introduce the puppy after your child is more emotionally steady and is also excited and ready for the addition.\n\nIf you’re convinced this is the right time to add a puppy to your family, consider the option of an older puppy who has been well socialized to children during their first few months. Find a 6- to 10-month-old puppy who has been given up for reasons such as a move or human allergies to the puppy. After they’re past the intense nipping phase, puppies are less likely to think of the kids as littermates, also known as siblings.

However, some dogs would prefer to remain your only pet. Imagine if your significant other brought in a new, younger version of you to keep you company. If your dog can’t get enough of you, adding a puppy may not be their first choice. For more tips on introducing a puppy to your resident pets, flip to Chapter 7.\n\nIf you’re trying to decide which breed is compatible with your dog, put yourself in their paws. Two Golden Retrievers can chase balls all day and wag their tails at everyone in your neighborhood. A Golden Retriever and a rottweiler, on the other hand, are a combination similar to oil and water. By nature, rottweilers are stoic, serious-minded, self-contained dogs who are mindful of their surroundings. A Golden Retriever is friendly, engaging, impulsive, and passionate about new experiences. Though I’m sure some exceptions exist, bringing these two under the same roof will be anything but relaxing for the dog, the pup, or the members of the household. Think about both the breed you have and the one you’re thinking of adding, and make sure that, at the end of the day, they have enough in common to coexist.",

However, you can simplify your life by choosing dogs whose personalities mesh.\n\nChapter 3 Browsing Breeds and Rescues: Choosing One That’s Right for You\n\nSure, almost all puppies love dog biscuits and a scratch behind the ears, but\n\nthe similarities end there. If you’re new to dogs and puppies, you may be surprised to learn that even though they’re all built pretty much the same, each one has its own personality, and each one faces the world in unique ways. Some thrive on human interaction; others prefer an independent lifestyle. Some love the general mayhem created by small children, whereas others find it less than thrilling. Some see houseguests as long-lost friends, and others see them as potential enemies. Some dogs cherish quiet, solitary times; others eat your house if you come home too late. What sounds good to you? Fortunately, you can choose with reasonably good predictability!\n\nIf researching the right dog for your lifestyle sounds overwhelming, you’ll love this chapter. In moments, you’ll be in the know after reading advice that’s stream- lined and tailored just for you. In the pages ahead, you’ll learn the difference between mixed-breed, designer-mixed-breed, and purebred dogs, as well as where to find them. If you already know what type of dog you want, you can",

Pup- pies, no matter the size and coat type, are nearly identical in terms of their natural instincts (to chase, explore, sooth pain or frustration and alert to distractions) and daily needs (to eat, drink, sleep, play, and eliminate).

Big dogs need more exercise outdoors and may require more investment in time and energy to handle their impulses to chase and explore than would a small dog with limited or no access to going outside. That said, all dogs need attention and involvement, and each one is excited to learn new words, games, and fun tricks like a toddler. (You’ll find more on the importance of teaching, socializing, and positively conditioning your puppy to all your life has to offer in Chapters 8 & 9.)\n\nThough dogs are one of the most varied species on the planet (thanks to people tinkering with their mating choices), they are still the same on the inside. The tiniest little teacup-size puppy, weighing less than one pound, will have similar thoughts, emotional capacities, and reasoning abilities as a 20-pound giant puppy of the same age, especially in the first four months of life. You could even mate the two — although I wouldn’t recommend it.\n\nDogs come in all shapes and sizes. Unfortunately, the sizes aren’t as simple as “big” and “little.” The following table can help you figure out how big large is and how little small is — just in case you ever need to know.

Each will have valid points that may tug at your heart, but where you get your puppy and how you chose to raise them is your decision (to be made with your family, if you have one). Raising a puppy is a huge commitment, one just below raising a child, so do it right. This chapter educates you on the difference between the choices of rescu- ing a puppy and buying one from a breeder.\n\nChoosing the breeder route versus the rescue route\n\nWhen you purchase a purebred dog, you’re buying into a multigenerational breed- ing effort. Individuals, known as breeders, devote their lives to matching dogs in their never-ending quest to produce healthy, conformationally sound, and emo- tionally consistent puppies. That’s a good deal for you if you’re the one purchas- ing a puppy.\n\nA puppy bought from a breeder costs money; a shelter, transfer, or abandoned puppy costs far less. Here’s the reason. Breeders are individuals whose only focus is to raise a specific breed of dog — or to design a specific mix of breeds, such as a Labradoodle or Maltipoo — to produce healthy puppies. These breeding\n\nprograms find the healthiest parents for their puppies and ensure that the puppies they produce have a head start in socializing and training before you even bring them home. Your money is paying for that service.",

This is not to say that you cannot condition these pups to life as you live it, but you’ll need to invest a lot more time upfront, especially if your puppy is wary or defensive of new experiences.\n\nDo you have the time and presence of mind to socialize a puppy who is unfamiliar with new experiences? If not, are you willing to pay a trainer or puppy daycare center to do extra socialization for you? If not, seek out a reputable breeder or find a shelter or rescue organization who has raised your potential puppy with its birth family to be sure that their early experiences were crafted from the start.\n\nOf course, you will have a lot to do after your puppy comes home (see the chapters in Part 2), but early social experiences with home and family life must be crafted to condition your puppy to roll with the punches, so to speak. That’s what takes extra know-how and time if your puppy has had no experience before you adopt them.\n\nIf you decide to take the purebred dog route, remember that well-respected breeders are worth their weight in gold. These individuals start socializing and handling their puppies from the second the puppies are born so that, by the time you pick up your puppy (around eight weeks), they’ll be familiar with human handling, being restrained, and living life indoors.",

For starters, good breeders will have as many questions for you as you do for them and will insist that you sign a contract that includes health and behavior guarantees. This document also insists that you return the puppy to the breeder should anything happen that causes you to rehome them. (To learn more about what qualifies a good breeder, flip to Chapter 4 and find a list of their qualities.)\n\nWhat are some other differences between a purebred and a mixed breed? Purebred dogs cost more — between $600 and $6,000. (The high end of that range is rare, but some championship show dogs and unique designer-mixed-breed dogs can fetch this price).\n\nMixed-breed dogs, also known as random breeds or mutts, are created when pure- bred dogs (or other mutts) mate with another breed or mixed-breed dog. This dog will have a random mix of traits from two or more parents. No two mutts are ever alike in look or personality.\n\nJust as capable of love and devotion as purebreds, mixed-breed puppies often happen by accident when people don’t spay or neuter their dogs and then forget to contain or watch their dogs. Because this often happens in parts of the world where leash laws and spay-and-neuter ordinances aren’t reinforced, many of these “oops” litters are uploaded to sites like petfinder.com or adoptapet.com or transported to shelters or adoption agencies where there’s a bigger need for pre- cious “adoptables.” The bottom line?

Though the theory has been questioned, it claims that you get a larger range of possible traits by matching two completely different breeds.\n\nPurebred or designer-mixed-breed dogs generally offer more predictability regarding their looks and interests, which can be both a plus and a minus, as you’ll soon discover. A random mix will have a more blended look and feel, with certain qualities of either parent more dominant than others. Finding a breed that’s predisposed to a trait or look you admire, or figuring out which breed types you’d prefer in your mixed-breed puppy, takes much of the guesswork out of assessing the puppy’s developing look, behaviors, and needs.\n\nThe designer-mixed breed is the latest craze to hit the dog world. To create a designer-mixed breed, breeders mindfully mate two purebred dogs to create a new, unique breed. This idea began with an attempt to create hypoallergenic seeing-eye dogs by mating standard poodles with Labrador retrievers. The result- ing dogs were coined labradoodles, and though they didn’t catch on as seeing-eye dogs, the craze caught on in the public sector. Now breeders have created designer mixes of every shape and size, and the list of designer breeds is nearing 100. Table 3-1 shows just a few of these fun new breeds.",

Are you wondering how a breeder can get away with selling these mixed breeds at such high prices? Some are in it just for the money, following current trends and selling their puppies online to any buyer. Other breeders are as serious about their lines of designer breeds as breeders of single breed lines, making the same effort to choose healthy parents with health clear- ances and stellar temperaments to create puppies with these same qualities.\n\nFor example, the puggle (a pug-and-beagle cross) has a longer snout than the pug, which is genetically healthier, hands down. Most owners hope that with this cross, personality-wise, the beagle’s scent-chasing obsessions will be toned down and that the marginally higher trainability of the pug will seep in.\n\nIf you’re considering a designer breed, you can’t exactly be sure of what you’ll get. A purebred dog’s size, weight, and interests can be predicted. A mixed-breed dog, designer or not, has a random mix of either trait in no particular order. If you’re thinking of buying one of these fun and fancifully named breeds, make sure you like both mixes — you can end up with the look of one and the personality of the other.\n\nEverything about your puppy is predetermined by the combination of traits avail- able from each parent. The dog pros would say that each puppy has its own, unique genetic inscription — for the coat color and the tail type right down to the sound of their barks and their reactions to strangers. Just as humans are pairings of their parents’ traits, so are dogs. When similar dogs are bred consistently over many generations, the puppies will begin to look and act like their parents.

A West Highland white terrier, for example, is always white, with little variation. If this breed mated with a black-and-tan cocker spaniel, however, the puppies would have varying coat colors. Because the coat types of those two breeds are also different, each mixed-breed puppy would come out with its unique look.\n\nBecause purebred dogs have a more limited pool of genetic choices, health-related considerations can often be passed from parent to puppy: Some examples are hip or elbow dysplasia; chronic skin, eye, and ear conditions; heart murmurs; and eyelid malformations. Because mixed-breed dogs have a larger pool of genes to work with, they have more random occurrences of these ailments and, some would argue, are healthier for it.

The first step is to get a better handle on the term purebred, a term lots of people use without really understanding what it means.\n\nPurebred dogs are a relatively new phenomenon on the dog evolution trail. Having lived alongside us for over 14,000 years, the mindful breeding of dogs began only a few hundred years ago. Until that time, dogs generally reflected the landscape of where they lived: short-coated dogs in the hotter climates, thicker-coated dogs in the northern hemisphere, sure-footed dogs in the mountains, and so on.\n\nOnce people figured out that they could mix and match dogs to produce puppies of similar size and temperament or to suit their fancy, they began to pair dogs to serve their individual needs. Farmers bred dogs to guard or herd their flocks; merchants used dogs to move their produce or deliver goods from one town to the next; and hunters developed breeds to retrieve or to alert to their chosen\n\nquarry (a fancy term for a defenseless animal such as a bunny, bird, or fox). Breeds were created for many other purposes too, from border patrol to dog racing to mere cuddling.

Various countries have parent clubs that not only register dogs but also organize get-togethers (known as dog shows) and sporting events to highlight different breeds’ form and functionality. In the U.S., this not-for-profit club is known as the American Kennel Club, or AKC. The club is also responsible for defining how dogs should look, move, and act (known as the breed’s standard), and it recognizes dogs who come closest to the organization’s ideal.\n\nThe AKC, as well as other breed clubs — the Canadian Kennel Club, the Nordic Union Kennel Club, and the original Kennel Club located in the United Kingdom, for example — organize the different breeds they recognize into various subgroupings that highlight similarities between the breeds. In the following sections, I give you a quick description of the seven breed groups listed by the AKC.\n\nA proactive lot, dogs in the Sporting group were bred to help man sustain them- selves by flushing (scaring out of hiding) birds and retrieving the ones that their masters shot.

They can’t cope with long hours of isolation; coupled with a lack of exercise, this isolation fuels anxiety. An unhappy Sporting dog is destructive, hyperactive, and impulsive. This isn’t a good mix — especially for your couch and end table.\n\nThe dogs in the Hound group are a happy lot with a 1-track mind; their fascination with hunting propels them through life and allows them plenty of opportunity for employment. Though you may have no interest in hunting a fox, chasing deer, or treeing a raccoon, your hound puppy probably will.\n\nOriginally teamed in pairs or packs, each hound was prized for their instinct to follow game without depending on human direction. As a result, a hound’s friendly manner and pack mentality result in a dog who enjoys family life yet is generally independent enough to entertain themselves.\n\nThe Beagle, Greyhound, Irish Wolfhound, and the Foxhound are in this group.\n\nThere are two types of hound: those that hunt by following the scent of their chosen pre, and others who trail animals by sight — commonly referred to as Scent hounds and Sight hounds. Both should be kept on a lead when outdoors, because their instinct to chase hasn’t been bred out of them and you can’t outrun them.

When living in the country, these dogs must be contained to keep them from roaming off in pursuit of some self-assigned task. They can adapt to apartment dwelling when given daily walks and an occasional romp in the dog park.\n\nCarefully consider your situation before choosing a guard dog. Raising children and dogs is challenge enough. Territorial breeds can overstate their job as guard- ian, protecting your home and children against all intruders — including friends, extended family members, daily workers, and even other children. These dogs quickly suffer career stress in busy houses. If your heart’s set on a territorial breed, structured training is a must.\n\nThe Herding group breeds were developed during the agricultural age, when their herding skills were prized by caretakers of sheep and cattle across the globe. Man put great effort into fine-tuning these herding instincts when developing the breeds in this group. Even though these skills are no longer a priority, each dog’s behavior in the home is reflective of them. For example, a dog bred to herd sheep is often seen herding children.

    "page_content": "Though the practice is rare, some owners still use fighting breeds for sport. These owners usually don’t neuter the dogs (because doing so would diminish their fighting tenacity) and often neglect them. Because of this mistreatment, these dogs may have many litters of puppies, and their genes can seep into the domes- ticated gene pool, possibly causing the breed to be more aggressive. When choos- ing a dog from this group, trace its history or talk openly with the breeder or previous owner about their breeding philosophy and the temperaments of the dog’s parents.\n\nThe lovable little miniatures in the Toy group have been bred down from larger dogs. Even though they can be cuddle companions, many still have their original breed characteristics firmly set. Take the miniature pinscher (or min pin), for example. A distant relative of the Doberman pinscher, the min pin is an astute watchdog who sounds visitors’ arrival before they even knock at the door.\n\nWhen assessing specific breeds, research their ancestry. Even though their size is different from their ancestors’ size, their genetic impulses may be undeniably similar. Don’t pass on training them simply because of their toy-like appearance.\n\nConstant affection without direction results in a Napoleon-like complex, which is reflected in behaviors from chronic barking to marking and, often, aggression. You’d be surprised at how much damage a 5-pound dog can inflict!\n\nToy breeds are fragile by design. Even though certain breeds are stockier (the pug and the Cavalier King Charles spaniel, for example), they’re all tiny — especially as puppies. Be mindful of this puppy around larger dogs and young children: Tod- dlers can easily hurt or overwhelm the puppies if they mistakenly confuse them for a stuffed animal.",

Choosing a puppy is a decade- plus relationship, so resist the immediate gratification of buying puppies online or over the phone in place of selecting a respected organization or breeder who’ll take care of your puppy (and take the time to socialize them) from their very first breath.\n\nAfter you’ve narrowed your search, you need to choose a few places or people to contact. You’ll find a handy cheat sheet in the pages ahead listing the best ques- tions to ask a puppy provider, like where the puppies have been raised (inside is best), whether or not they have been seen by a vet or given inoculations, and whether they have a jump start on crating or house-training.",

It doesn’t often happen, but be prepared. Always remember that nothing is more disappointing (for you and the pup) than bringing a puppy home and finding that it isn’t a good fit.

Think of the advice and tips in this chapter as my way to teach you how to find a puppy that connects with you and each member of the family.\n\nOne vital stage of any puppy’s life happens before you even bring them home. Dur- ing that early stage, from birth to 8 weeks old, the type of environment surround- ing them forms them in ways that will impact their behavior in your home. A puppy from a peaceful environment, where the owners mindfully nurture the parent dogs and puppies, is generally better equipped to handle the transition into a new home than a puppy who has lived in an overcrowded, neglected kennel and who has been severed from their litter at an early age. The reason is simple: A puppy’s brain is still developing even after they come out of the womb, and it continues until they’re 12 weeks old. Life stress can have a much greater impact at this time.",

Good places to go for information are www.adoptadog.com, www.puppyfinder. com, and www.puppyfind.com. However, some people in the puppy industry make the argument that no ethical breeders would sell puppies online because, much like a child-adoption agency, anyone with an ethical bone in their body would want to meet a prospective parent so that they know who is adopting their “furry children” and what kind of home they’ll be providing.

It’s far better to find either a rescue that has used a foster home or a breeder or shelter who’s helped your dog to adapt to life in your town and will be on call to help you to settle your puppy in as they start life with you.\n\nHere are some tips for finding a good pup on the Internet:\n\n» In addition to emailing the puppy’s shelter, owner, foster family, or breeder, speak to the other party by phone. Ask about the breeds and genetic health of the puppy’s parents, if they’re known. If the parent’s histories are supposedly known, but no one has health certifications to back that history up . . .think twice: Puppies are everywhere, and you want the one with a healthy future.\n\n» Ask for a copy of the puppy’s health records. People can easily and\n\nimmediately send them via text or email. If you’re even slightly suspicious about the information, call and speak to the veterinarian’s office directly. Ask the hospital staff questions about the puppy and the owner: Was the puppy raised with their mother and littermates, where were the puppies housed, and how much social interaction have they received? If the people caring for the puppy are unwilling to share this information, reconsider this puppy. The ideal puppy is one raised indoors with the birth family and with lots of loving social interaction — anything less may spell trouble for you in the long run. » When talking to people in contact with your puppy, listen for loaded",

Is the location clean? Does the puppy look happy and healthy?\n\n» If the puppy is already separated from their mother, ask what age they were at the time of separation. Puppies removed before 7 weeks lack their mother’s formative influence, which is invaluable for learning emotional regulation, bite inhibition, and respect. These puppies may never make up for the valuable time lost and may need a lot more structure and time to socialize and train.\n\n» Ask the owner to send you the purchaser’s contract outlining the\n\nagreement between you. Don’t buy a puppy without an agreement that clearly states what will happen to the puppy if you discover that they have a health issue or find that their temperament isn’t a good match for your family. If you’re unable to return the puppy for any reason, do not proceed. All good breeders should let you return their puppies, no questions asked.\n\n» If the breeder checks out and prefers that you pay online, use an online escrow account to hold the funds until your pup has arrived safely and you’ve had them checked out by your veterinarian. A reputable breeder should agree to this plan if they’re more devoted to the placement of their puppies than to their dollar value.\n\n» Beware of the bargain-basement puppy.

The short explanation is that shelters operate out of a municipal building or kennel-type facility and often care for a range of pets, whereas rescue organizations generally focus on one type of animal, and foster those animals out to live in homes until they are find their forever homes.\n\nAlthough puppies are generally born in litters ranging from 3 to 13 puppies, occa- sionally a mother dog gives birth to just one puppy, called a singleton. These pup- pies are at a disadvantage because they would normally learn much more about the world by way of interaction and play with their doggie siblings. Unless you’re a seasoned dog owner, avoid singleton puppies: These dogs need someone who can help them learn boundaries and good manners. The same advice applies to hand-raised puppies — puppies who, for whatever reason, lost their mothers early on and had to be rescued and raised solely by humans. Even if raised with litter- mates, without their mother’s influence and lessons on self-restraint these pup- pies often develop pushy, unyielding mannerisms and a tendency toward resource guarding. Explore other options and leave these puppies to someone with lots of special needs’ puppy-raising experience.",

Many shelters and animal welfare organizations rescue puppies from dire situations and care for them until they’re adopted. Some of these puppies are removed from their mothers at an early age (before 8 weeks old) and need special care before they can be put up for adoption. Other puppies are brought in with or without their mothers and left at a shelter. Those pre- adoption weeks are critical: If you adopt a puppy whose early life was stressed, you cannot make up for lost time. Even if you’re able to increase the socialization and touch conditioning levels in the first weeks you bring them home, there may be certain wary or dramatic reactions you can never completely condition out of your puppy.\n\nAs you surf the web, you may notice a lot of rescue organizations within a 1- or 2-hour drive from your home. Rescue organizations are similar to shelters in that they are not-for-profit, tax-exempt organizations. They differ from shelters because they generally focus on one species — say, dogs — and gather volunteers to serve as foster families until their rescues find their forever homes.

If they’re serious about the placement of their puppies, they’ll ask you a whole list of questions to ensure that you’re a good fit for their breed and their puppies. You may feel more scruti- nized than if you were adopting a child, but don’t be put off by their questions, because in the end you’ll receive a puppy who has been loved and well cared for since its very first breath. If the breeder rejects you, ask why and ask whether they can provide information that can help you determine what dog would work best with your lifestyle.\n\nWhen evaluating breeding facilities, go with your gut. If you drive up to a breed- er’s kennel and get a bad vibe for any reason, such as dirty facilities, an inability to answer your questions, or not being allowed to see your puppy’s mother (or father, if he’s on the premises), leave. The urge to save a puppy from a bad envi- ronment may be overpowering, but unpleasant facilities or mistreatment can result in sickly or poorly socialized puppies. You will pay in the long run for having a puppy who may need more time and attention than you can devote in order to undo the isolation from real-life experiences your pup has endured. It’s better to back out of the driveway and place a quick call to the local chapter of the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA) to report bad breeders than to buy a puppy and possibly live to regret it. You’ll be doing yourself a favor, and you’ll help put people who are breeding purely for financial gains out of business.",

Here are my top five:\n\n» Puppy brokers or agents: Puppy brokers (also known as puppy agents) are smooth-talking dog people who will promise to get you a puppy from their list of top-of-the-line breeders. Initially, these folks seem like saviors, descending to save you from the hassle of locating a puppy on your own. Do not be fooled. Most brokers are just out to make a buck and fill orders as fast as they come in — but no decent breeder will ever sell their puppy through a third party. Puppy brokers will go who-knows-where to find you a puppy when you want it and mark up the puppies they find in order to lace their pockets. After you decide where you want to concentrate your search, finding a puppy on your own isn’t hard; Chapter 3 and this chapter walk you through the process.\n\nIf you’ve already paid a broker to find you a puppy, insist on speaking to the breeder, ask the broker to provide reviews from other customers, and check the health clearances on both parents.\n\n» Puppy mill breeders: Puppy mill breeders aren’t breeders; they’re farmers.",

Mother dogs are often bred every heat cycle (a horrific practice) and then killed off after they can no long produce large litters. Puppies are produced under tremendous stress and often live to wallow in feces. The noise of the dog’s barking is deafening. Individual puppies have little socialization or handling before they’re washed and primed for sale. Buying a puppy from this sort of situation does nothing but feed this practice. Do you want your money to go to someone who has such little regard for a dog’s life? Puppies from these situations are often more difficult to housetrain, chew to relieve anxiety that started long before you brought them home, and\n\nare hypersensitive to touch and sound. Sometimes it’s hard to determine if your puppy came from a puppy mill, but generally if you are buying your puppy from a middleman it’s highly likely that seller bought the puppy wholesale from a puppy mill where puppies are sold cheaply and not from a breeder who would never dream of selling their pups to a middleman.\n\n» From a box on the corner: If you ever pass a box with a sign that reads “Free to good home” or any similar message, promise me that you won’t look. Puppies are a mix of their parent’s genes and their early upbringing. In this case, you’ll likely have no proof of either. I have two words for you: Walk away.

A reputable breeder would never sell puppies to a pet store. So the pet store then contacts resale breeders who often breed many dogs simultaneously to meet the demands of the pet store. The resale breeders often stretch both themselves and their breeding dogs to the limit, and many of the facilities called — you guessed it — puppy mills (see the preceding bullet point) are understaffed. These conditions result in puppies who don’t get proper care or socialization with the human world. They may also be sickly, as puppy mills are notorious for being understaffed, resulting in filth, dirty unchanged water, and feces-encrusted cages that attract parasites and flies. Bacteria and illness frequent these environments and quickly spread from puppy to puppy. Why take the risk?\n\n» Craigslist, Facebook, Twitter: Although I’m not saying a breeder won’t have an online presence, online interactions don’t take the place of reaching out and speaking with the breeder, shelter, or rescue organization. If you want to begin your search online, explore sites like www.petfinder.com to locate rescue dogs or www.akc.org to locate breeders. After you’ve researched places and checked their reviews, and perhaps even reached out to some of their puppy owners on Facebook, it’s time to make the phone call and speak to the people in charge.

Generally, when you pay for a puppy, you’re paying for genera- tions of careful breeding and reliable temperament. A breeder who is generating mixed- breed puppies, giving them names like Chi-weenie and Shorkie and selling them at a premium, may well be someone who owns a puppy mill and is just pairing dogs they have housed in kennels.

If visiting a breeder, ask if you can meet the parents and spend a couple of hours observing the litter. Like all kids, all puppies have distinct personalities and varying degrees of sensory awareness. A puppy with a strong sense of themselves is forceful in play and with toys; a more passive puppy hesitates in new situations and often watches and considers before they jump up and responds. A playful puppy gets excited more easily and tries to engage their littermates in interactive activities like wrestling and tug-of-war.

Ask to visit in the morning or late afternoon because that’s when most puppies are awake and playful. If that isn’t possible, ask about the puppy’s schedule and how long you can stay. Avoid nap times or late-night visits. When possible, ask to stay for a couple of hours so that you can watch and interact with the litter over an extended period.\n\n» At a shelter: Speak with a staff member ahead of time to find out how many puppies are available for adoption. (You can also ask ahead of time whether they know the breeds or mix of breeds so that you know whether the type of dog you want is available.) Find out whether a private meeting area is available and whether you can observe a litter together. Ideally, you want to see your candidate interacting with other puppies to determine their sociabil- ity within a group.\n\n» At a pet shop: If you’ve settled on purchasing your puppy from a pet store, you’ll visit on your schedule. When possible, visit in the morning after the puppies have had a good rest. Ask to meet individual puppies separately: If one seems like a good fit, bring other puppies into the greeting room, too, to see how your candidate interacts with them.",

Though you can shape your puppy’s habits once you get them home — redirecting your playful puppy if they jump on you, for example, or having them learn to fetch a toy when you come home — their worldview is set early on. In this section, I tell you how to evaluate a pup’s personality based on simple exercises and on watching how they act with their littermates. These are basic categories — a litter may have more than one, or may not have one, of the personality types:\n\n» Assertive: Assertive and playful puppies have a lot in common, so it’s easy to confuse the two. At first glance, both might seem social and interactive. You may think, “Wow — that one has spirit.” However, keep watching. Do they steal the toys from the other puppies or play too rough? Do they scale the enclosure or climb on the backs of their littermates as though they don’t exist?\n\nThese bossy behaviors are sure signs of determination, smarts, and willpower, but unless you’re in the market for a dog who’ll win agility competitions, think hard about how those characteristics will mesh with your home life. If you have the time to channel (and challenge) this puppy, take them home.\n\nHowever, if you have other demands on your time and you’re hoping for a puppy to reduce your stress, another personality type may suit you better. » Playful: Puppies in this group are quick-thinking, fun-loving, and engaging.",

When playing with different puppies, they adjust their tempo to reflect the other puppies’ demeanor. Another term for this personality type is social butterflies because they’re all about engaging without being too headstrong. This temperament is ideal for an active person or a family with older children.\n\n» Independent: These puppies interact in playful encounters some of the\n\ntime, but are also happy sitting or playing with a toy on their own. Stoic and contained, these independent thinkers seem to have been born with an old soul.\n\nThese pups are ideal in structured homes where owners fully respect their sense of self and make a commitment to teach them. Because these puppies are mindful and alert, they’re best suited to calm homes with older kids or no children.\n\nDependent: This type loathes solitude and wants to please. If socialized with people, they gravitate to you as if seeking your approval. That attitude leads this puppy to the head of the class or into the doghouse, depending on how you play it: If you direct and reinforce good manners, you’ll have more than 100 percent cooperation; but if you try to discipline your puppy, they’ll see your interaction as a reason to replay bad behavior over and over and over.\n\nBecause of their trainability, dependent puppies are wonderful companions, but they can end up on the B list if they don’t receive direction.\n\n» Relaxed: This calm personality type beautifully balances play, interaction, and sleep — doing all three on their own time.

An N puppy may lick or place their mouth on you gently, whereas a P puppy will show concern.\n\nWhen choosing a puppy for a home with young children, I look for a puppy who has a very low sensitivity to touch — one who barely notices a toe squeeze and doesn’t ruffle at being petted the wrong way or restrained for a short burst of time (fewer than 5 seconds).\n\nWhen your prospective puppy least expects it, tap two metal spoons together behind their back, then drop them 3 inches from where they’re standing. Gauge their reaction: Do they startle and freeze? How quickly do they recover to explore the spoons or take a treat from your hand? If the puppy shows intense spoon interest, score A; a nonchalant glance, an N; and a fear reaction noted by cowering or withdrawal, a P.\n\nStand and wait until the puppy is no longer interested in you. Suddenly fall to the ground and exclaim “Ouch!” Does the puppy race over and pounce (A), come to sniff or lick your face (N), or cower and run in fear (P)?\n\nIf you have a family, choose a puppy who rolls with unpredicted reactions and noise. You have enough on your hands without your puppy getting involved.\n\nLift the puppy 4 inches off the floor by cradling their midsection. Hold them there for at least 5 seconds. Do they wriggle and bite furiously (A)? Do they relax and look around (N)? Do they look fearful and constrict their body posture (P)?",

Raising them will take concentration, consistency, and time. Their favorite expression: “What’s next?”\n\n» All N: Easygoing and contained, this puppy will be pleasant and self-assured, though perhaps not motivated to follow your agenda when it conflicts with their own. Their favorite expression: “Is this necessary?”\n\n» All P: This puppy has weak self-esteem and needs your reassurance to feel safe. Without proper lessons and socialization, they’ll be shy. Their favorite expression: “It’s been three minutes — do you still love me?”\n\n» Mix of A and N: This active puppy will want to be in the middle of everything but will show slightly more impulse control when stimulated. Their favorite expression: “Let’s do it again!”\n\n» Mix of N and P: This puppy will be easygoing and gentle, yet with a stronger sense of self than a completely passive pup. Because they’re more composed, they’ll be an ideal puppy for a calm house with or without older children. Favorite expression: “Another back-scratching, please.”",

With the right pup, you may be able to avoid some of these situations. However, no situation is perfect, and very few puppies can glide into a new life without a few setbacks. In this section, I walk you through some of the special considerations you should have when picking out an older puppy.\n\nDepending on where you go to look for an older puppy, read the following ques- tions to ask and points to consider before taking your little guy or gal home:\n\n» Breeder: A breeder often keeps a puppy for showing purposes. If the puppy doesn’t grow into “show dog” potential, they’ll be made available for sale. Sometimes, finding this puppy is like hitting the jackpot — provided the puppy has been living indoors, has received individual attention, and has been well socialized. At other times, it’s a disappointment, especially if the puppy has lived in a kennel for the past 6 months.",

    "page_content": "Because a breeder’s older puppy may be unfamiliar with the routines of home life, they may not know what stairs are or may not have spent time in a yard. And, no matter what the breeder tries to tell you, a puppy who has spent the majority of their time in a kennel isn’t housebroken. Find out where this puppy spent their early months before racing into this venture. A puppy who can’t emotionally acclimate to your home life isn’t a reasonable candidate for you. » Rescue organizations: Rescue organizations foster their puppies in homes, and you’ll be able to both visit the home and question the foster parent about your puppy’s socialization, temperament, and training. This can be a good option when considering an older puppy. The same rules apply, however, to the important question to ask: Has the puppy been raised indoors around other pets and people? How are their reactions to everyday sounds and stimulations? How is their house-training going? Don’t be afraid to ask or test for more detailed information, like whether the puppy enjoys snuggling or being held, what toys are their favorites, whether you can remove high-value items like a bone or food dish, and how they behave on a leash. If you have a family, make sure the puppy relates to everyone, including other pets.\n\nYou may find a puppy, young or old, who is being fostered in another state. Visit if you can; otherwise, look for a different puppy. People who are fostering are in the business of getting their puppies adopted, and they want to do it especially quickly if a puppy is a lot to handle. Sometimes, these people may enhance a dog’s behavior traits and disregard others. See Table 4-1 for alternative interpretations of general behavioral descriptions. Buyer beware.",

Were they found on the side of the street, or have they grown up in the system? Has the puppy in question been returned more than once? Ask what the reasons were — you may be adopting a dog who couldn’t be house-trained, was fearful of kids, or showed aggression when chewing a bone.

Always remember to let your head lead your heart. Nothing is sadder than rescuing a dog only to have to return them because they couldn’t cope with your lifestyle. Be strong — find out ahead of time whether you and the puppy are suited to each other by performing the following tasks:\n\n» If you have kids, introduce them to the puppy before you bring\n\n» If you have an animal menagerie at home, make sure the puppy can cope with the creature chaos. Ask whether the owner has other pets at home (if the puppy has been living there) or whether anyone has conditioned this puppy to other creatures.\n\n» Ask a staff member (or the previous owner) to lift the puppy.

Initially, your puppy will need only a few simple items, such as bowls, some toys, and a crate, gate, or pen for an enclosure. This chapter can help you make the right choices about purchasing puppy supplies, from what kind of toys and self-soothing objects to buy to where to place the crate. A little planning will give you peace of mind and ensure that your puppy comes home to a calm, consistent, and supportive new environment.\n\nThe first few days after you bring your puppy home will be a bit of a blur; the most important task to focus on is your puppy’s sleeping and house-training routines. Quick responses to commands like Sit and Come are important (and you’ll learn about early puppy conditioning in Chapter 7), but your initial focus is on helping your puppy adapt to your schedule and getting comfortable living with you.\n\nTo avoid overstimulating your puppy or blowing your budget before the puppy has cut their baby teeth, remember that less is more, at least initially. Though you may have the temptation to buy everything you can for your pup — from the latest toy to a designer raincoat — I suggest that you bring a list and stick to it.",

Think of it less as a cage and more as a bedroom.

Ideally, your puppy should sleep near someone at night, so your bedroom is a good location. Keep the shades in the crate room drawn during the day.

The Snuggle Puppy, for example, comes equipped with a heartbeat and hot water bottle to radiate the feeling of sleeping with other puppies.\n\n» Prepare a docking station or CD player to play music when your puppy is left alone. Dogs don’t like silence in general and may grow anxious of distant noises they can’t explore. The point of music is to drown out the sounds of silence and help your puppy tolerate on being alone.\n\n» Install light-blocking binds to create a den-like atmosphere at night\n\n» Provide a pacifier equivalent. Hollowed-out toys stuffed with kibbles\n\n» Induce calm and sleeping by adding a crate cover.

Left alone regularly for more than 4 to 6 hours often results in hyperisolation anxiety — a lonely puppy who’s overreactive and hyper, in other words. If you must leave your puppy for long stretches, consider a playpen-crate combination.\n\nA crate isn’t a teaching tool. Your puppy needs lessons from you to learn how to act in all areas of your home and in everyday situations, such as mealtimes and family interactions and when people come to visit.\n\nIf the idea of a crate still turns your stomach, you have other options. To contain your puppy when you’re not home (necessary for house-training and to teach your puppy to rest when you’re not home), you can use a playpen or a very small, gated room. If your puppy is older, you can use a leash to keep your puppy with you when you’re home and show them how to act in the rooms you share.\n\nThough playpens are ideal enclosures for young puppies under 12 weeks of age, and can be used to supervise a puppy in multiple areas of a home, they begin to lose their magic when your puppy reaches 4 months of age. At this time your puppy won’t want to be separated from you, and the use of a playpen may lead to excessive barking or frustration chewing.

Yes, it’s more convenient to feed your puppy in a bowl, but when you’re able, portion out meals into reward pockets or treat cups and use the food to motivate good habits, such as coming when called, chewing toys on their mat, or pottying in the proper place.\n\nFor now, purchase a few bowls to start — two for water and one to contain your puppy’s meals. Keep bowls for water inside the house and out, but sequester your puppy’s food dish to control and vary feeding locations based on your early social- ization efforts. For example, you may choose to feed them on their comfort mat one day, saying “On your mat” as you lead them there; in their crate the next day, saying “In your room”; and in the car another day, saying “To the car.” Meals are powerful motivators and are useful in conditioning and socializing your puppy during the first month you spend together.\n\nAs for the type of bowl, stainless steel is ideal because it’s easy to clean, it doesn’t break, and its weight reduces the chance of the bowl being knocked over. Size the bowl to your puppy’s breed: small, medium, or large.\n\nYou can buy bowls with stands that raise the dish to make eating more ergonomi- cally comfortable and that are advertised to help prevent bloat (which they do not). These bowls certainly make eating look more comfortable, but they aren’t totally necessary, because dogs are physically designed to be ground-level feeders.\n\nBloat is a fairly common and fatal dog disease if not caught immediately.

Modern convenience is lost on some dogs, who still like to interact with their food instead of gobbling it up in one sitting.\n\nYour puppy will repeat behaviors that get your attention, food, and fun. The sim- plest way to motivate your young puppy’s good manners and routines is to reward positive choices — sitting for attention, for example, or standing on all four paws instead of jumping. In addition, if you praise, pat, or play with your puppy each time they make a good chewing choice, you’ll save yourself a lot of destruction in the long run. The following sections present other tips to get your new puppy started on the road to good behavior from the moment you adopt them.\n\nA food reward is often the best way to encourage your puppy’s focus and make a positive association with learning. If your puppy’s excited for the dry food you’ve chosen to feed them, look no further. Ration out all or a portion of each meal, and divide that amount into treat cups or reward pockets (as described in the following list).\n\nIf you feed your puppy moist or raw food or they don’t excite to their kibble, find another type of treat that gets them excited. Remember that your enthusiasm with the treat is more important than the amount or size of the food reward. Here are two great ways to use food to train and motivate your puppy’s earliest learning:",

(I discuss this training technique in Chapter 10.) To create a treat cup for your puppy, purchase an inexpensive plastic container (or use an emptied deli container), cut a small, round hole in the lid, and fill it halfway with dried kibbles or broken-up dog treats.\n\n» Reward pockets: Place your puppy’s treats in one of your pockets or\n\npurchase a food pouch to stow snacks. With food bits at the ready, indoors and out, teach and reward your puppy whenever the opportunity knocks. Did they sit before you opened the door or go to their mat or crate — reward them as you say “Good puppy!” Are they nervous going down the stairs? A few tidbits tossed on the ground may be all the incentive they need to try a little harder. Use meals or treats for rewarding your puppy for returning to you and for outdoor pottying. Check out Chapter 10 for more uses of reward pockets.\n\nAlthough you may be tempted to buy every toy and bone available to you, don’t! Puppies, like children, have specific likes and dislikes, and overwhelming your pup with options is disruptive. They’ll grow up thinking everything on the floor is fair game — even your beloved, oh-so-broken-in slippers. Keep in mind, though, that a new puppy will spend their first few days nosing about and won’t be interested in interactive play for another two to four weeks.",

Puppies like objects that bounce, squeak, and roll. You’ll have plenty of selection, and, for the record, your puppy won’t mind if you choose a bird squeak or a fox, or a red ball or a blue one — it just needs to bounce, roll or squeak (or all three) and you’re all set. Choose a couple of toys to discover what captures your puppy’s heart, and look no further.\n\nStuffed toys can be great fun for puppies who think of them as small prey animals, especially when they squeak. Some puppies, however, go beyond the toss- and-play mode and insist on ripping them from limb from limb until the squeaker is removed. This isn’t an ideal game for puppies, because squeakers can be dan- gerous when you remove them, and the stuffing can be ingested. Search for toys with the word indestructible on the packaging.",

When giving your puppy freedom outside, use a 25- to 50-foot-long lead to allow them freedom to play while giving you plenty of leash to interfere with a rambunctious puppy and/or hold onto to retrieve them if they should wander off. For young puppies, long lines are great for wandering in a yard or field — take along some favorite snacks and reward your puppy every time they “check in” with you. You can also use long lines to encourage off-lead training as your puppy matures.\n\nI discuss training leashes used on older puppies in the section “Exploring Future Needs, Modern Gadgets, and Training Tools,” later in this chapter.

The whole socialization process, from meeting new people to conditioning to loud sounds to getting your pet accustomed to all the nuances of your life, is so important that I’ve devoted an entire chapter (Chapter 9) to it.\n\nMeanwhile, here are a few products you may choose to get a head start on the socialization routine.

A sling rides over your shoulder and allows you to tuck your puppy into the pouch when they’re in a calm mood so that you can keep your puppy close when conditioning them to new sights and sounds or when moving about your home or building. To accustom your puppy to the sling, lay it flat in or near their sleeping area and hide food in the folds, so they can smell, explore, and find treasure in it. To familiarize them with your smell, put a shirt in the pouch, too.\n\nMost puppies are transitioning from full-time companionship with littermates to a singleton lifestyle in your home. Though you don’t want to carry them about full time, lest they develop an overdependence on your presence, using a sling to con- dition them to your lifestyle and to socialize them in the world beyond can be as reassuring as it is convenient.\n\nIf you have other pets agitated by seeing a newbie having so much direct contact, make a different selection from the products in the following sections.\n\nSmall travel kennels, especially if you plan to travel with your adult dog, should be conditioned early and used to provide your puppy with a feeling of safety. Condi- tion your puppy to their carrier by sprinkling food, treats, and toys around them in the carrier. If your puppy is wary, you may also unzip the openings and play in and around it.\n\nThe sooner you get started with the carrier, the faster your puppy will grow to accept that being in it means more time with you. Use the carrier as you would a sling — to transport your puppy about, slowly conditioning them to the sights, smells, and sounds in and about your home. More socializing tips in Chapter 9.",

Imagine being led about by a necklace: you’d pull away and feel trapped, too (a phenomenon known as oppositional reflex). Unless you’re a pro with leash training and you have your timing down to a science, consider using compassion wear, which conditions your puppy to walk near you through a system of guiding, not jerking or pulling. These user-friendly collars require little to no strength to control and allow you to focus on positive reinforcement to encourage your puppy’s focus and cooperation. The two types of conditioning collars are no-pull harnesses and head collars.\n\nYou can reference my website, SarahSaysPets.com, for photos and video clips specifying leash use and collar options.\n\nStick to buckle collars and freedom lines when guiding puppies younger than 4 months old.

This communicated the statement, “Hey, wild one, settle down!” The head collar has the same effect. Left on during play, the pressure on the nose discourages rowdiness and mouthing. By placing a short lead on your puppy when you’re expecting company, you can effectively curb jumping habits. Barking frenzies are drastically reduced, and training is made simple as you guide your puppy from one exercise to the next. Another plus is that leading by the chin demands minimal physical strength, so nearly everyone can use it — kids too. (See an example in Figure 5-3.)\n\nAfter your puppy is used to the nose strap, you’ll be able to guide them like a horse on a halter.\n\nHow often you should leave the head collar on is a question best answered by your puppy. If yours is relatively well behaved, you can use it exclusively during walks and lessons. If they’re the mouthing, jumping, or barking type, leave the collar on whenever you’re able to supervise them.\n\nThe head collar must fit properly around your puppy’s neck. If it’s too loose, your puppy can pull it off and perhaps chew it. You want the neck strap to fit snuggly, with one finger’s worth of space between the neck and the strap.

Their reaction reminds me of the first day my mother dressed me in lace — I hated it, but after an hour or so, I hardly noticed it at all. And your puppy will learn to tolerate the head collar. When you see them flopping about like a flounder, be patient. After they realize that they\n\ncan’t remove the collar, they’ll forget about it. Some puppies take an hour to adjust to the feel of the collar; some take a day or two. Place it on their head three times a day for 20-minute intervals until they accept it.\n\nNeck wear collars, also known as choke or prong collars, are available but not rec- ommended for modern-day dogs and dog lovers. The idea behind a neck wear collar is that it applies pressure around the dog’s neck when the dog strays, bolts, or chooses to explore in another direction. This causes a feeling of entrapment or worse, affixation, which leaves a dog feeling more stressed by situations like seeing another dog or walking with you. Long term? Neck collars do more harm than good.\n\nIf you’re confident that you can guide your puppy by their neck, choose a check chain or martingale collar. This collar slides over your puppy’s head and rests high on the neck, just behind their ears. The check chain has a section of chain that should be centered between your puppy’s ears.

When out walking with their dogs, humans tend to go in straight lines, confident in the belief that they are in charge because they are holding the leash. But restricted, linear walks are unnatural to puppies, who prefer to meander and explore. Your puppy will pull on the leash in an effort to increase the meandering. You will pull back, increasing the restricting.

It’s a learned habit: Getting it right takes some practice and the right leash and training restraint. The following sections have some tips about finding the right equipment; be sure to review the earlier section on freedom lines and the joy your puppy feels when exploring naturally.\n\nAs your puppy matures, they’ll be less tolerant of being left alone. If they’re still too curious to turn loose in your home, it’s time to begin leash training. (Flip to Chapter 7 for specific instructions.)

Letting your puppy ride in your lap or hang their body halfway out the window when you drive may seem fun, but it’s a bad idea. Here’s my rule: Confine your puppy while driving. It’s safer for you, your puppy, and other motorists.",

Initially, this leash is great for exercising. Your puppy can run like mad while you stand there reading the morn- ing newspaper. When you progress to off-leash work (see Chapter 13), the retract- able leash is a staple.\n\nDon’t use a retractable leash near roads or heavily populated areas. Its high-tech design takes getting used to, and even a seasoned pro can lose hold of the slack. If you’re out with other people, watch their legs. If a person gets sandwiched between you and your prancing puppy, they’re in for a rope burn.\n\nPuppies have been shown to respond to learning games and clicker training as young as 7 weeks old, so feel free to begin these lessons now. Anything that encourages your puppy to repeat activities like pottying in the right place, chew- ing on their toys instead of yours, or going to their mat is a good thing.\n\nIf you’ve never formally been introduced to the clicker, allow me: This small, handheld device (see Figure 5-4) makes a sharp clicking sound each time it’s pressed. Pair this sound with a food reward and you’ll discover power that would make Pavlov proud. Your puppy will alert to the sound, and when they connect this noise with a food reward, they’ll be prompted to repeat whatever action makes it click. Use the clicker properly to condition good behavior in mere sec- onds. Sounds too good to be true, right? It isn’t, and you can get started with pup- pies of any age. Check out Chapter 11 for more tips on how to use your clicker to help your puppy use good habits.",

Meals are better used as rewards for good behavior and offered during social times when you and your puppy are together.\n\nI love a good treat dispenser — it has so many uses. If your dog suffers from iso- lation anxiety that leads to barking or destruction when left alone, consider a device that can be preprogrammed to dispense food when they settle on their mat and stop barking.

As you’ll discover if you haven’t already, your puppy has an uncanny ability to recognize and respond to you in ways that resemble the attachment between parents and children; just being around your puppy creates loving feelings. (In science-speak, our bodies release the loving hormone oxytocin). So, doesn’t it make sense that we treat these sensitive, intelligent creatures kindly? Dogs — like kids — raised with com- passion and respect grow up happy. And happy is good.\n\nThe word anthropomorphic gets tossed around a lot in the dog world. It’s a fancy term for our very human tendency to project our feelings onto other animals. It’s a no-no according to many, but a little anthropomorphizing could be a not- so-horrible thing if it keeps people from being too harsh or cruel with their dog- gies. After all, it’s science that’s telling us of the similarities between puppies and little kids. I’ll show you how to balance your anthropomorphic impulses with the realities of what makes your puppy separate and unique.\n\nDog training methods are like parenting philosophies: You can choose from lots of different approaches, and what works for one kid may not work for another. Thanks to science, more and more professionals are swinging to the proven stud- ies demonstrating that dogs actually learn best when routines and language are positively reinforced. But some training advocates still rely on decade-old alphacentric methods that stressed the need to dominate and relied heavily on traditions passed down from a time when dogs lived primarily outside and worked hard for a living.

If you’re having trouble finding a class or trainer in your area, ping me at sarahsayspets.com or search online at sites like https://apdt.com/https and https://m.iaabc.org.\n\nUntil the 21st century, most trainers borrowed from the growing philosophy that dogs were domesticated wolves, with many of the wild, unruly survival skills that captive wolves used to cope with being locked away. It wasn’t until the mid- to-late 1900s that a scientist named David Mech, trudging into various Northern reaches of the United States, revealed the truth about how wolves live and relate to each other. Funny thing — wolves have strong family ties and devotion to their young that’s not so different from how humans live and love.\n\nAs far as the evolutionary debate and how it relates to your relationship to your puppy goes, suffice it to say that dogs are no longer considered domesticated wolves, but rather a subspecies that split off to form a friendlier, more pleasing species that continues in their eagerness to please us. Imagine that! Brian Hare, a researcher from Duke University, wrote a compelling essay stating that, with both dogs and people, our survival was less survival of the fittest (as another great naturalist, Charles Darwin, proposed) than survival of the friendliest, because we required group cooperation to thrive.",

In 2008, he did what at the time seemed like a simple comparative analysis showing beyond a reasonable doubt that dogs have similar cognitive abilities to 2-2½-year-old children. Researching at the University of British Columbia, Coren set out to determine which breed of dog was the smartest based on a set of questions that tested their responsiveness to human direction. Although the findings caused quite the ripple in the dog world, the significant undisputable discovery was that all dogs, regard- less of their breed or intelligence rating, are capable of processing information, reasoning linear outcomes involving getting something they desired (such as a bone or freedom), and deducing simple arithmetic. He also showed that dogs could learn up to 150 words.\n\nDr. Coren’s publications opened the floodgates, and soon studies from around the world were conducted on topics including a dog’s musical preferences to similarities in the body chemicals released during petting.\n\nFast-forward to 2012 when another human neuroscientist, named Gregory Berns, an MD/PhD who specialized in MRI analysis, did a similar experiment with dogs. By tracking their brains’ responses to familiar smells, sights, and verbal directions, he discovered beyond a reasonable doubt that dogs show similar proactive and excited reactivity to everyday routines and people as we do.",

Much of it is devoted to olfactory receptors and sensory tunnels that collect information about your pup- py’s present situation: from the noises they hear to the sights and smells sur- rounding them. We people swapped out sensory awareness for complex thinking skills, in the process growing the frontal lobes of our brains, or what’s called the cerebral cortex.\n\nWith all the hoopla about dogs, some naysayers still claim that dogs are just not as smart as everyone thinks.

I can’t even smell sugar in my morning coffee.\n\n» Every dog has a secondary olfactory center located in the roof of their mouth, called the vomeronasal organ, that alerts them to slight changes in body chemicals (known as pheromones) that help to distinguish the age, sex, and sexual receptivity of other dogs.\n\n» Dogs can smell moods. Slight changes in our perspiration cue our dogs into\n\nSure, dogs aren’t smart like people are, but it’s precisely because they are not people that dogs are brilliant in their own right, and the sooner you can recognize, respect, and reward your puppy for their version of clever, the sooner you’ll be navigating your own love story.\n\nWhen walking your puppy, allow some time for sniffing — especially in areas where dogs congregate.

He discovered that all mammals (humans, too) are born with five master emotions that rule all their behavior, day in and day out. I’ll relate the five emotions to dogs only, but don’t be afraid to let your imagination run wild — we have more in common with our dogs’ emotional landscape than you might think.\n\nSeeking is the master emotion that drives a dog’s survival: They hunt to find food, water, and companionship. As a social creature, your puppy can’t survive on their own and will form close bonds to whoever they spend time with, which often sur- pass their connection with other, unfamiliar dogs.\n\nScientists have recorded 100 expressions that dogs use to communicate with people. Many of these expressions are easy to identify: I want some, play with me, pet me now, time for breakfast, let’s go for a walk! See how many expressions you can read — you know your puppy best.\n\nPlay is somewhat of a mystery: No one can put their finger on why it happens — it just does. Dogs play when they feel safe where they are and who they are with: It’s a good measure of your puppy’s mood.\n\nPlaying and seeking are baseline emotions that you can use to measure your puppy’s mood accurately.

Learn how you can interpret your puppy’s five key expressions to help adjust to eye situations:\n\n» Relaxed eyes: Notice your puppy’s eyes when you’re enjoying a moment together. Comfortably gazing at you in calm and mutual adoration, pupils (that dark circle in the center of their eye) in proportion to the colored ring, AKA the iris? That’s their relaxed eye.\n\n» Squinty, appeasing eyes: If your puppy is squinty it means one of three\n\nthings — they are trying to appease you (or another person or dog), they are slightly fearful (you can tell if they’re rump is lowered), or there is something actually caught in their eye. (Not usual, but if they scratch or rub their eye, you should check.)\n\n» Hard eyes: A dog who stares with hard eyes and a rigid body is feeling threatened or defensive. If pressed this dog — or puppy — will bite. » Whale-eye: This happens, and is not a good thing, when a puppy is so stressed, frustrated, or anxious by a stimulus or situation that you can actually see the whites of their eyes. If this happens to your puppy, do whatever you can to calm them by removing the stimulus or taking them out of the situation.\n\n» Avoids eye contact: If your puppy avoids your eye contact, they are either feeling overwhelmed by your interactions (are you staring down at them intensely?) or are just trying to ignore you altogether (not an uncommon behavior when they are in their adolescent phase — see Chapter 12!). If you can’t tell right off the bat, check out their other indicators (ears and tail, in other words) to see if they are up (attitude) or down (conflicted).",

    "page_content": "Like your puppy’s eyes, the tail is extremely expressive and can be used to gauge how they’re feeling throughout the day. As you’ll discover, there’s more to a tail wag than what meets the eye: Its position as well as the tempo of the wag deter- mine whether your puppy is happy or anxious or feeling more assertive.\n\nTo get a read on your puppy’s tail, observe its position. First, figure out their neu- tral tail — where it sits in relationship to their rump when they’re calm. Using that position as tail-neutral, see whether you can identify these “tell-tail” emotions:\n\n» Happy: Your puppy will lift their tail slightly and wag it from side to side when\n\n» Excited: When your puppy is excited, they will raise their tail a bit more and\n\nwags more frantically; this often happens when you return home.\n\n» Arched: A puppy who feels threatened (generally a behavior not seen before 7 months of age) may arch their tail stiffly over their rump. This puppy will stand their ground! Proceed with caution!\n\n» Tucked: A puppy who tucks their tail beneath their body is trying to look\n\nsmall. Often accompanied by cowering, this one is signaling fear or anxiety.\n\nYour puppy’s tail wag doesn’t always signal joy. Learn these tempos so that you can distinguish a happy wag from an anxious or aggressive wag:\n\n» Happy swing: Puppies who wag their tails so hard that their bodies wiggle are extremely happy: Discover what makes your puppy feel this good — maybe a special treat, toy, or happy voice — and use these things to train and reward your pup as often as possible.",

    "page_content": "» Sway: A sway is a shorter wag, and the emotion varies depending on where it’s held. A sway on a slightly elevated tail expresses interest or arousal. If the tail is swaying at rump level, your puppy is showing submissiveness. A below-rump sway on a puppy displays fear.\n\n» Twitch: Twitching tails convey intense emotion. One that’s raised above the\n\nrump signals agitation. A low twitch? This puppy is panicking.\n\nWant to know just what your puppy thinks about Aunt Edna’s visit? Look at their tail — if it’s wagging on the right side, they’re happy. Tails that wag to the left communicate caution or insecurity.\n\nYour puppy will also use their ears to express emotion and will often use them in concert with their tail: Ears and tail up convey confidence and a bold curiosity; ears and tail lowered communicate caution or fear. Learn these poses and all the other ear expressions in between these two extremes.\n\n» Relaxed: All puppies have different ears. Some flop, others point, and some stand part way up. Study the ears when your puppy is relaxed to determine their resting pose.\n\n» Seal-like: This adorable, seal-like look is copped when your puppy draws their ears back: When it’s paired with a full swing of their tail, you no doubt have a happy and excited puppy on your hands.\n\n» Antenna: This is the classic one-up, one-down expression that lets you know your puppy is focusing on two different noises at the same time. Your puppy is one of a very special species that can be tuned into different sounds simultaneously.",

Look around you — whatever your puppy is staring at may be causing excitement or frustration.\n\n» Pinned back: With ears pinned back, and body curved and lowered to the\n\nfloor the puppy’s message is feeling small and powerless.\n\nMouth: Grin or grumble, stress panting, play panting, yawning\n\nYour puppy’s mouth is similar to your own: When cracked in an open, smile-like curve, it generally conveys joy (unless the puppy is panting due to hot weather or excessive activity, like bone chewing, a stint at the dog park, or exhaustive play). A closed mouth is common when a dog is sleeping or playing independently. A tightened lip pout is seen in puppies who are concentrating or doing something unpleasant, such as meeting a new dog or smelling something foul. A growl where facial muscles are tightened and lips are curled communicates that your puppy is feeling either defensive or seriously afraid. Note your pup’s mouth positions so that you become fluent in their lip language.\n\n» Mouth slightly open: A relaxed jaw that’s slightly open is similar to a child’s\n\nimpish or happy grin.

They space the barks out, and\n\n» Stress whining: These puppies want something they can’t have or reach: It might be a toy or your attention or a completely random item — but you’ll know the instant it happens, because it will pull on your heartstrings. Beware, though — if you reward whining, you get more and more and more whining until it becomes a lifelong habit.\n\n» Reactive barking: These puppies alert to any sound or stimulus. Because the\n\nsound is high-pitched and repetitive, your goal will not be to stop your puppy — reactive barkers are born, not made — but to develop an off switch so that you can curb the barking once it starts. Want a clue? Flip to the barking section of Chapter 16.\n\n» Baying, or howling: This is generally a breed-specific sound isolated to\n\nhound-type dogs and Nordic breeds. These dogs use their voices to communi- cate with other dogs and to express frustration when left alone or feeling stressed.\n\n» Play growl: Puppies often growl during play, especially during confrontational games like tug-of-war, physical wrestling, or face-to-face sparring. It can and should be easily calmed or diffused by redirecting the play to an object or chewing type of toy.\n\n» Pleasure seeking: Many dogs growl or moan when enjoying a rub or scratch. Unless the sound is paired with a stiff posture and direct, hard-eyed stares, it’s a pleasurable sound.",

It’s common for puppies to communi- cate their boundaries with other dogs; however, if they’re growling at you, get professional help. Though you can redirect your puppy if this type of aggres- sive stance continues, it may become a habit. And you know what they say about habits: They’re hard to break.\n\n» Belly growl: A more serious growl emanates from the belly. This growl means the dog is about to bite. Often paired with raised hackles, flattened ears, and exposed teeth, this dog will lunge and snap or bite the source of its frustration.\n\nThere’s a direct parallel between dogs who bark and people who yell: See if you can make the parallel. A puppy barks at seeing the neighbors walking their dog. If you yell, your puppy will interpret your raised and frustrated tones as barking. Though your puppy may stop barking for the moment, they’ll go back to barking the next time around, because your yelling was simply interpreted as backing them up. Yelling isn’t helpful. Find a better solution to your barking problems in Chapter 16.\n\nYour puppy’s fur is filled with lots of scents that signal — to every dog they meet — their demographics as well as their latest poop-rolling adventure. None of it matters much to us humans, although when their fur stands up on end, take notice. When your puppy’s hair lifts along their spine (technically referred to as piloerection), your pup is definitely trying to tell you how they’re feeling at the moment — and it’s not always confident.

On the flip side, this pattern is\n\nspotted in dogs that are less confident and even fearful.\n\n» Aroused and conflicted: Patches of hair raised at the shoulders and the base of the tail and no raised hair on the back. This pattern covers a range of reactions that a dog may be feeling, from ambivalent to conflicted.\n\nPiloerection is just another fancy word for goose bump.\n\nI’ve never understood the lure of being a dog whisperer. Dogs don’t listen to whis- pering people. Pride yourself instead on being a dog listener, because taking the time to listen is most important.\n\nOne of the most helpful similarities between puppies and babies is their basic needs: All of them need to eat, drink, sleep, go potty, and play. The main differ- ence is the way they express their need confusion. Babies cry when a need over- whelms them; puppies, though they may occasionally whimper, get nippy and restless.\n\nAs kids mature, they learn to communicate their needs with words; your puppy can’t talk, but they’ll mature, too. In place of spoken language, they will gesture their needs if you’ve laid the groundwork by pairing each need with a routine. Involve everyone in your household in these rituals, and within a week you’ll cre- ate habits with your puppy that will stick for life.

Though your puppy may take some time to “pay it forward” with their love and devotion, each passing day brings you closer to that ultimate connection. Need by need, your bond grows.\n\nYour puppy is most awake at dawn and dusk: The fancy term is that they’re crepuscular. People are diurnal; some animals, like raccoons and owls, are noctur- nal; dogs are crepuscular — they rest a good 75 percent of the day. Though this makes them ideal companions, they can grow frustratingly fussy when overtired: Think of a toddler having a meltdown. Now imagine that toddler with teeth.

Like kids, some puppies have a hard time putting themselves to sleep, espe- cially when excitement levels are high. Designate a quiet room for napping (using a crate, pen or gate to contain your puppy), and place them down for scheduled naps during the day. In my house, having 9 a.m. and 1 p.m. naps helped me sched- ule my day, too. Each time you lead your puppy to their resting area, say a cue word or phrase, like “In you go.” Eventually, your puppy will go to this area on their own when they’re tired.\n\nPuppies enjoy predictable routines. A hungry puppy is understandably upset and may show you by eating anything — even difficult-to-digest items such as tis- sues or walls. Schedule feeding times and stick to them, whether you feed all or a portion of your puppy meal by hand or from a bowl. If you notice your puppy get- ting nippy or difficult, check your watch. The behavior may be a result of hunger tension.\n\nIn Chapter 5, I argued for hand feeding your puppy their meals when possible. If you’re out of the house around normal feeding times, however, you can now buy timed feeders that you can set or program with an app. If your schedule is less than predictable or you know you may be called away during mealtimes, consider this option.\n\nA young puppy has a high metabolism and should have more frequent meals. Schedule three to four meals throughout the day, slowly phasing out meals as your puppy matures. At some point after your puppy reaches 10 months to a year, they may naturally drop one meal. Most dogs, however, prefer two feedings a day.",

That said, try to monitor their drinking habits while house- training them. Establish a drinking station for your puppy and keep their dish there, whether it’s empty or full. Give water with meals, after playing, chewing, or napping, and as you’re on your way to the potty area.\n\nRestrict water after 7:30 p.m., unless you want to be up all night taking your puppy outside.

Pretty cool.\n\nI don’t think house-training can be summed up any better than with the wonder- ful maxim “Whatever goes in must come out.” Your puppy’s biological clock will have them eliminating on demand.

(See the next section.)\n\nThe free-play zone should be free of items that the puppy shouldn’t play with (such as the hanging towels and doll shown in Figure 7-1). A little puppy-proofing can prevent a lot of problems.\n\nIf your puppy’s free-play zone blocks another pet’s domain, reorganize your resi- dent pet’s area well in advance of the puppy’s arrival.

As you introduce your puppy to new rooms in the house, either bring their familiar bed or use a similar one in each room.\n\nPuppies need a lot of sleep to support their rapid-fire growth and mental devel- opment. If your puppy isn’t getting enough sleep, you’ll know it — though sleep may not be the first thing that comes to your mind. An overtired puppy may become hyper and nippy to the point of being aggressive if you try to interfere with their constant motion.",

Designate a gated area as their sleep space, or put their crate in an area free from a lot of foot traffic and incoming light so that they can sleep undisturbed. (It wouldn’t hurt to pull the blinds or drape a towel over your puppy’s crate to create a den-like feeling.) Because puppies are attuned to all sounds, block distant noises by leaving on soft rock or lullaby music so that your puppy doesn’t feel left out. Whether you choose a crate or a gated room, make it cozy by laying down a mat and an article of your clothing, as well as a puppy pacifier (see Chapter 5) or bone to self-soothe your puppy if they should grow restless. Avoid fluffy beds or cushions because either can encourage chewing or accidents.\n\nSleeping is one of your puppy’s basic needs — just as important to their develop- ment as eating and drinking. When puppies don’t get enough sleep, they act fran- tic to the point of distraction, often becoming incessantly mouthy. Many show aggressive tendencies when continuously overtired, much like a colicky infant.\n\nUnlike people, who as adults are diurnal — resting 8 hours or one-third of a 24-hour cycle — dogs are crepuscular, most awake at dawn and dusk and resting for the remainder of the day. This factor makes them ideal pets because your day can be organized to play 20 minutes an hour with them before 9 a.m. and after 4 p.m.\n\nAs far as creating a habitual daytime sleep schedule goes, organize their nap times during the day for those times when you’re busy or working anyway. Until they reach 8 months of age, your puppy should have a noontime visit to feed, take comfort, and relieve themselves.",

Every time I see our sweet Tally dog curled up in his crate, I start wishing I had a crate to crawl into when days are long and times get tough.\n\nHere are ten steps to introduce your puppy to their create. (For more about what type and size of crate to purchase, flip to Chapter 5.)\n\nIf you live in a large home, consider two crates — one in the kitchen area and the other in the bedroom or quiet place to encourage rest. Place the crate in the free-play zone, placing old clothing articles or a pad on the bottom (unless your puppy pees on them — then keep the bottom bare until your puppy learns to hold their bladder).\n\n1. Initially have the crate in the open area, using it as toy central.\n\nPlace toys, treats, and bones just inside the crate, and then let your puppy’s curiosity take over. From the start, place their food near the opening, gradually moving each meal closer to the door.\n\n2. After a couple of days, play the “in-we-go, out-we-go” game.\n\nTake high-value treats and sit by the opening of the crate. This is a hands-off exercise — no touching or forcing your puppy into the crate. Shake the cup or hold a treat to your puppy’s nose, and then toss in the treat. Say “in-you-go” as your puppy goes into the crate to find it, and “out-you-go” as they leave the crate. Play this game three to five times and quit before your puppy loses interest.",

Place all high-value chews or favorite toys and note any time your puppy enters the crate to play or rest.\n\n5. After your puppy is comfortable in the crate, say “In-you-go” as you lure them in using a fist of kibble or a few high-value treats.\n\nSit down at the opening, say “Bye for now” and shut the door; ask a helper to drop in a favorite chew through a side opening or do so yourself. Within 5 seconds, open the door and place another treat inside the crate, before your puppy has a chance to pop out.\n\n6. Gradually lengthen the close-door time until your puppy is accustomed to varying closures from 10 to 60 seconds.\n\nAgain, either drop in a chew as you walk away or ask a helper to feed treats in the side window while you walk away.\n\n7. When you’re confident that your puppy can settle inside their crate with a self soothing toy, choose a natural nap time and leave them alone for 15 minutes with a favorite chew and gentle music playing, and then dim the lights.\n\n8.

After your puppy is calm being left alone, use the crate for nap times.\n\nYoung puppies need lots and lots of sleep, and are most awake at dawn and dusk. Puppies need two full nap periods and a good night’s sleep to mature into calm, sensible dogs. When overstimulated and chronically entertained, puppies develop into impulsive dogs who need a lot of activity to self-soothe. Use your puppy’s natural sleep cycles and chew toys to teach them to self-soothe or rest when left alone.\n\nCrates aren’t ideal for older puppies who may be suffering from separation anxi- ety. If separation anxiety is a concern, read more about that topic in Chapter 16.\n\nWhether you’re paper training your puppy or teaching them to potty outside, establish a schedule as the one outlined in Table 7-1 and decide on a route to speed through shared rooms to the door or to the papers, which should be set in a spe- cific spot. (See Chapter 14 for a diagram of a sample route.) Place papers in the specified area or select a door to use and a potty area no more than 10 to 20 feet from your home’s entrance.\n\nContaining your puppy in certain areas of your home is important, especially if your house is large and you have other pets or children. Too much freedom or activity can set bad habits in motion, especially if your puppy is fearful or easily excited, so you’ll want to determine which rooms your puppy is allowed into at first and set up the potty route accordingly.",

The worst-case scenario is a drag, I know, but be prepared, just in case. And no matter how disappointed, disgusted, or frustrated you become, don’t stress or correct your puppy.\n\nTo be prepared for any mishaps, bring the following items on the trip:\n\n» Paper towels and cleaner » Pet safe carpet or upholstery cleaner » Plastic bags » An appropriately sized plastic crate » A towel to spread under the crate to prevent slipping or to clean up accidents » A lightweight collar with an identifying phone number in case of emergency or\n\nCrating your puppy in the vehicle is important for safety and comfort.

If you have kids or other dogs, tire them out and use bribes to ensure their cooper- ation. Don’t tolerate fighting and commotion between siblings — your puppy will have enough on their mind. Keep all stress at bay for the first 24 hours. If you have other pets, keep the puppy separated with a puppy playpen, praising your resi- dents for sniffing or approaching the puppy.\n\nIn this section, I walk you through the best way to introduce the puppy to your family — including both people and pets. No doubt everyone will be fast friends after puppy settles in, but you can ease the inevitable initial fears and discomfort by handling day one well.\n\nTo introduce your family to the puppy, gather everyone involved in Team Puppy, hand everyone some puppy kibble, and create a large circle by sitting on the floor or grass. Place your new puppy in the center of the circle and let them approach everyone on their own. Dole out toys or small food rewards so that everyone can give the pup a present when first meeting them.\n\nIf you have kids, the day that your puppy first comes home may be on a future fondest-memories-of-childhood list — talk about excitement! However, part of your job is to keep the kids calm because too much squealing and loving in the first 5 minutes can be somewhat overwhelming for a pup. Explain the situation ahead of time and ask your children to help you make the puppy feel comfortable by speaking quietly and petting gently.",

The saying “Monkey see, monkey do” applies to children, too. Because your children pick up on habits by watching you, show them how to act with actions instead of words. I can assure you that\n\nsomething is bound not to go as planned, but if you stay calm and ignore the impulse to badger or boss, you’ll have a more relaxed home on your hands. Kids react poorly to negative reprimands. Stay cheerful and model the right behavior while your children are watching. Like monkeys, they see — and then they do.\n\n» Assign tasks. Make a chart assigning everyone a job ahead of time. Make raising the puppy a fun family affair where everyone plays the role of the parent.\n\n» Talk to your kids ahead of time. Get them involved in your plans and warn them of all the possible situations that may arise. For instance, the puppy may be sad and withdrawn and may not want to interact with anyone — they’re missing their littermates. Though the kids may be let down, everyone must respect the puppy — they’ll snap out of it in a few days. On the other hand, the puppy may be nippy and want to play rough — again, a carryover from their first family. (See Chapter 15 for tips on handling a mouthy puppy.) Make sure the kids are aware of the possibility, and help them interact with the puppy when they’re calm.\n\nRemind the kids that puppies need a lot of sleep — especially during the first 6 months. Let them decide on the music choices and placement for the puppy’s nursery, and show them the sleep schedule so that they can take a role in putting the puppy down for naps and bedtime.",

Each time your dog sniffs or looks at the puppy, mark the moment with a word like “puppy- good” or use a clicker as described in Chapter 5, and then toss a treat to the floor: Find it! If you’re unconcerned about your dog’s reaction, let the two sniff each other while your friend either holds the puppy in their lap or sits with the puppy on the floor.\n\nNext, proceed into the house.

Let your resident sniff first, and then guide the puppy back so that when walking slightly behind, you can gradually walk the puppy to greet your dog, rump facing.\n\nIf you’re earnestly concerned that your resident dog may harm the puppy, muzzle them or keep hold of their leash to enable easy interference.

House-training, fran- tic chewing escapades, and nipping and jumping habits are often more than twice the effort because one puppy influences the other and, in the end, may tune you out. You need the 3 Ps — patience, persistence, and positive attitude — to keep the training ball moving forward at a steady pace. That said, raising two puppies can give you hours of entertainment watching them play and experience life together; just keep this image in mind while you’re devoting hours to raising your twins.\n\nWhen left together 24 hours a day, your puppies will form a strong bond to each other, which is good. However, that means they’ll also be less attached to you, which makes influencing their behavior difficult. To prevent that level of bonding, separate them at least twice a day and, if possible, let them sleep in separate bedrooms. Have two crates so that each pup gets used to having their own space.",

Sure, certain similarities string all pup- pies together. However, like humans, each one has their unique personality and temperament that affect the way they relate to their world. In a multidog house- hold, everyone must be sensitive to the needs of each puppy.\n\nLet your puppies establish their hierarchy. Personality affects the way puppies relate to one another. Groups of two or more puppies form a hierarchy, with the most outgoing, assertive one assuming the bossier position and often the more protective, demanding role. You may have trouble figuring out which puppy is the leader of your group because it’s not often a straightforward delineation. Puppies don’t base hierar- chy on who’s the biggest or who came first. Nor do they base it wholly on who’s the toughest. Hierarchy is most often based on who’s the most responsible or level- headed in a given situation. The puppy with both the brains and the brawn wins out. Regardless of your feelings, you must support their arrangement.\n\nRemember the discipline rules. The best advice I can give you here is don’t get hot-headed with your puppies. Your puppy won’t understand things that happened moments ago, and together, both pups will view you as a buzzkill. Sure, you’ll get frustrated when you find a mess of any kind — I get that! My family rescues prob- lem dogs, and sometimes I think it’s just to test my resolve.",

Teach your puppies two names: their names and a universal one that you can use when they’re together, such as “dogs,” “girls,” “boys,” or “babies” — whatever works for you. Using a single name makes calling them easier; “Girls, come!” rolls off the tongue easier than “Buddy, Fifi, Daisy, Marlo, come!” Play the name game with the treat cup, shaking it as you run from them, and then turn- ing and saying “Wait!” Reward them by tossing the treats down (see the Find It game described in Chapter 20) so that you don’t mistakenly encourage jumping.\n\nFeed your pups separately. If you’re having difficulty keeping the puppies sepa- rate, create two separate feeding stations. (See Chapter 5.)\n\nAvoid starting a toy war. I know you want them both to have a toy. But one puppy keeps insisting on having both. You give it back to the other puppy, and they take it away. The giving and taking can go on all day. Remember your leadership rule: If the more assertive puppy wants both, the more assertive puppy gets both. Period.",

Your cat may head for the highest cabi- net and stare at you reproachfully when you bring home a puppy. If you have a confident cat, they’ll probably wait stoically for the puppy to approach close enough for them to give the pup a solid bat on the nose. In any case, keep your responses low-key. Overreacting can put all species on edge.\n\nFollowing are some suggestions to help the introductions go smoothly:\n\n» Place the puppy in a gated room or open playpen (with a special chewy for diversion) and let your cat wander around the room at their own pace. Don’t try to influence or interfere in your cat’s reaction. Reward any interest your cat takes in the new addition with a favorite treat or toy. If you\n\ncan, teach your kitty “Up, up” by gently luring or lifting them onto a high counter or cat tree. If your puppy starts acting up, however, step in to calm the puppy.",

Directing your frustration at the cat will only make matters more stressful. Your cat is defining their space, which is a necessary boundary for coexistence.

If your pup’s reaction concerns you, attach a leash to curb their enthusiasm and redirect them to a toy or bone. If your puppy seems too assertive (generally experienced with older puppy rescues), they may not have had the proper conditioning for living harmoniously with other animals during their socialization period.

Try to keep yourself calm, especially when your puppy gets excited, because you don’t want to encourage hyper greeting manners before your puppy has cut their baby teeth.\n\nOrganize the day, using the sleep and house-training schedule shown in Table 7-1, and remain patient with accidents or exploratory chewing, especially if your puppy is in the infant stage (younger than 16 weeks of age). If you notice your puppy chewing furniture or wires, use a distasteful bitter-apple spray to discour- age their curiosity, or tape the wires out of reach. Puppy-proof each area you share by placing objects such as dish towels and shoes out of reach. Prevention is worth pounds of cure.\n\nAvoid loud or physical interference, because it only overwhelms your puppy and discourages bonding.

Voilà — you now have a treat cup. Shake it and reward your puppy until they make the association between the sound and getting a treat. Next, call their name when they’re unsuspecting as you shake the cup and reward their attention. Within a day or two, phase off the cup and watch as your puppy alerts happily to their name.\n\n» Teaching your puppy where to go to get each of their needs met: Your puppy will be most focused on where to go for food, water, sleep, and potty. Assign words to each routine, as detailed in the Needs chart (Table 6-2) at the end of Chapter 6, to help your puppy associate words with actions.\n\nThe first month with any puppy is a critical bonding time. As the days and weeks pass, you’ll notice your puppy’s confidence and awareness of you growing. They’ll initiate routines by going to the door when they have to go out or standing by their bowl at mealtime. Your puppy is communicating with you! Now you can continue the magic by thinking of early efforts as though you were teaching a newly adopted baby English as a second language. Your puppy’s first language is posturing and body cues; though they can learn words, you’ll need to pair them with gestures and routines. By paying attention and interpreting the meaning behind their actions, you’ll forge a bond that will last a lifetime.\n\nWhen puppies are very young, their whole bodies and brains are absorbed in encoding new experiences, from the smells in your kitchen to the sound of the dishwasher. How puppies react to these sensations depends on their temperament and how you engage and interact with them.",

I love the toys that are attached to a pole — they’re perfect for exhausting and diverting your puppy’s hunting and grabbing energy. Use the phrase to play and redirect your puppy whenever they’re excited; when greeting people, for example.\n\nDon’t worry about retrieving games at this stage: Most puppies are too young to share. The goal of this game is to teach your puppy what they can grab, have, and hold (“Go get your ball or toy!”) and what they can’t — namely, you. » Play treat cup games. Make a treat cup as described in Chapter 5. After your puppy makes the sound-treat connection, teach them the 4-paw rule. Shake the cup and reward your puppy if they hold still; if they jump, lift the cup above your head and look up. Flip to Chapter 8 to learn how to condition an automatic Sit, and then incorporate Sit into this routine. You can use the treat cup to teach your puppy to come to their name — shake the cup and run 5 to 10 feet away from your puppy as you call their name; say “Come” as you release the treat.\n\n» “Say hello.” To encourage proper greeting manners, wait to greet your puppy until they’re calm enough to sit for a treat. As you reach out to pet them, say the words “Say hello.” Eventually, they will learn that this phrase means to greet people on all four paws. Remember that good manners start at home.",

When your puppy nips your hand, let your hand go limp until they stop, or remove their mouth gently as you remind them to give “kisses” instead. More tips in Chapter 15.\n\nPuppies aren’t perfect: Not all their messages are heartwarming. Sometimes your puppy will be bored and demand your attention by jumping up, barking, or grab- bing a shoe or paper towel. As you work through the many joys and frustrations of puppyhood, remember that even bad behavior is a sign of healthy development — it signals that your puppy is engaged, focused, and dependent on you. This is the time to start communicating your routines and rules to your puppy in a calm, consistent manner.\n\nA lot of what they learn happens when you don’t even know it, like when you approach their gate or crate. Wait until your puppy is relaxed and standing on all four paws in their enclosure before you open or step over a gate or lift them out; otherwise, you’ll teach the opposite. It’s the same with food or water: Wait to lower the dish until your puppy can sit still. Whining and barking are other habits that start early. Ignore your puppy’s vocal demands unless you’re certain that they need to go out. More tips on dealing with all sorts of frustrating behavior are in Chapter 15; skip ahead, if you need to.\n\nPuppies, like kids, love attention. And, like kids, they don’t care if the attention is negative or positive. Shouting, pushing, and grabbing wont’ discourage a puppy — they’re interpreted as confrontational play and make a puppy more reactive, not less.",

Given all the sounds and stimulations they face, there is sure to be something that will likely startle your puppy: Fear of the unknown is completely natural and your puppy’s startle reflex, a powerful force. Stay calm. Though you’ll be tempted to soothe your puppy when they’re fearful of an object or sound, the best approach is to stay calm and act like it’s nothing. The been-there-seen-that attitude gives your puppy far more reassurance than bending over and soothing them, and it encourages them to look and bond to you as their authority on everything life-related.\n\nSome puppies relish the comfort of being held in someone’s arms. Many small breeds love the reassurance of being held tightly by someone larger whom they trust. But, like kids, no puppy wants to be held all the time. Pick up your puppy only when they’re calm and restful. If your puppy squirms to be let down, don’t take it personally. There’s a time to hold and a time to let go.\n\nWhen holding a puppy, keep their spine to the ceiling and belly to the floor: This is a great mantra for kids and grown-ups alike. I refer to the proper way to hold a puppy as the heart hold, where you embrace the puppy sideways so that your hearts are pressed together, holding their hips and shoulder joints snug to your body.\n\nPuppies don’t like to have their legs dangling, and many puppies feel scared when flipped on their back. If your puppy appears to be uncomfortable in your arms, they are. Ask your veterinarian or another professional how to best lift, carry, and hold your puppy if you need guidance.

Training exercises are just no fun, and the phrase “It’s your responsibility to feed Roxy” has a negative spin. The good news is that your kids get involved when the routines are upbeat and creative.\n\nBefore you teach the kids how best to play and teach the puppy, buy or make treat cups (see Chapter 5) and fill them with a trail mix of some tasty treats or mealtime kibbles.

Have the kids say “Wait” as they hold the toy in front of the puppy, but have them hold off tossing until the puppy is still.

Begin by standing with your puppy and child in the free-play area or outdoors. Give your child the treat cup, have them shake it as they call the pup’s name, and then have them run just five steps away from the puppy. After a short run the child turns and holds out their arm like a traffic cop, saying “Stop” in a strong voice. The moment your puppy stops and holds still they should drop a treat at their feet, saying “Find it!”\n\nIf the puppy jumps or nips, either place a freedom line on your puppy so that you can interfere by stepping on it or have the child cover their eyes with their hands (the peek-a-boo solution described in Chapter 15), or, if the puppy scares them, lift or place the child out of reach. (If your child is too young to manage this game on their own, recruit them as your special helper as you play it for them.)\n\n» Hide-n-seek. Give your kid (or kids) a treat cup and ask them to hide around the corner or a piece of furniture. Have them wait to shake the cup and then have them call their puppy the moment you say the child’s name. When your child is out of sight, ask your puppy “Where’s Sophie?”— at which point Sophie should call your puppy as she shakes the treat cup. If your puppy is confused, go with them to find the child.

Lift the kids onto the counter or tell them to hop up there for safety. After they’re safe on the island, they should ignore the pup until they’re calm or, if they want to continue playing, toss toys once the puppy stands or sits calmly on all four paws.\n\n» See you later: As long as your kid and puppy are still working out the rules of play, make sure there’s an easy exit over the gate or out the door.

Teach the kids to toss treats on the floor and say “Find it” instead of directly handing the puppy the treat. Place treat cups in strategic locations and teach kids to use them to redirect the puppy when they become rowdy.\n\nTreats tossed on the floor teach puppies to look down when they’re anticipating a reward.\n\nSet up situations that your pup can expect to encounter to teach them how to han- dle themselves — such as the kids’ running frenzies, snack time, or floor-level gaming. Redirect your puppy’s focus away from the kids, using techniques like the counter condition skills and desensitization techniques detailed in Chapter 15. If your puppy can’t detach from the kids’ fun, use a freedom line and a choice of compassion wear (see Chapter 5) so that choking their neck doesn’t intensify their frenzy. With a leash and the right training techniques, you can remedy many everyday occurrences between kids and puppies — behavior like mouthing and nipping, food grabbing, and chasing. (Chapter 15 provides more details on training to overcome these and other daily hassles.)\n\nGetting Help with Shaping Good Manners from Day One\n\nA puppy’s early learning takes place primarily through cause-and-effect. If they get any attention (good or bad) or a reward when they do X (X can be just about anything — sitting or jumping or playing with a toy or whining or pottying in the right place on the carpet), they’ll do it again.",

Because your puppy needs to relieve themselves after eating\n\nor drinking, resting, playing, or enduring long bouts of isolation, take them to an assigned spot in either a private and papered corner of your home or outdoors 10 to 20 feet from the door. Set a route to the bathroom area, and use words and gestures to guide your puppy each time you escort them. The important thing is to develop a routine. Here’s one I can recommend\n\n1. Take the puppy from the crate to the designated bathroom spot, saying “Go to the papers,” or “Outside.”\n\n2. Wait to give the pup attention until they’re pottying in the right place. 3. Say “Get busy” as they potty, either poop or pee. 4. Greet, play with, or walk the puppy after they’re done. In preparation for the inevitable “accidents,” set up cleaning stations in strategic places, equipped with paper towels and house-soiling spray.\n\nAll puppies are enthusiastic about their relationships and naturally try to get “up close and personal” whenever it’s time for a proper greeting. That means they instinctively want to jump up and engage in some face-to-face contact, just like Great-Aunt Ernestine used to do. If one of your human friends or relations is eager for a kiss, ask them to wait until your puppy is on all four paws before com- ing down to their level. Here are other tips and creative ways to elicit help in teaching your puppy the 4-paw rule.",

If you’d rather they chew on their toys and not on your running shoes, I recom- mend the following strategies:\n\n» Place puppy baskets around the house at your puppy’s level. Ask everyone to direct your puppy to the basket, by saying “Go get your bone!” Gather the toys and put them back when the puppy is done playing.\n\n» Choose a few different words for different toys — like “toy,” “ball,” and “bone.” Encourage everyone to name the object as they toss it. Soon your puppy will be able to identify up to five different toys.\n\n» Ask everyone to direct or redirect your puppy to their toys if they seem bored",

Talk to the doctor like they’re a neighbor. Do you feel comfortable sharing all your canine concerns with them?\n\nIf you’re unsure of which veterinarian to use, ask around. You can narrow your search by asking your friends and family whom they use and why.\n\nPuppies can be quite impulsive — they often swallow things that look edible before even considering whether they are. So, at your puppy’s first veterinary visit, ask the doctor for a recommended method for inducing vomiting. You should also find out the poison-control hotline number and always keep it on your phone in case of an emergency. Seek out a 24-hour emergency veterinary hospital in your area as well. Keep the hospital’s number by or on your phone. Accidents can happen during off hours, so have a plan.\n\nWhether your life demands consistent hours away from home or circumstance steps in to temporarily rearrange your schedule, knowing a dog walker can make the difference between a happy puppy and a stressed-out one. Puppies are like human babies in that they have a strong need dependency.

Consistent rituals, like food sleep and potty rituals, can make all the difference in having a puppy who feels calm and one that is anxious and out of sorts. In my world, training is as much for the people as the puppy. At the end of the day, puppies need to learn where to go and what to do in a range of situations: “Sit” as a matter of saying please, “Come” to mean that you’re standing together, and “Get your bone” and “Go to your place” as a way to offer comfort when your puppy is fretting or alone.",

Although a puppy may stop a behavior—who wouldn’t freeze if shocked or threatened by a virtual stranger? — their cooperation comes at too high a cost to their joy and well-being. Fearful puppies may behave because puppies, like kids, are easily intimidated, but the majority mature to become manic or defensive dogs. Please avoid trainers suggesting any of these techniques.\n\nSometimes you just need a kind professional to sort out just how best to raise your puppy to be the dog you want them to be.

That day, I swore I’d move to Barbados. However, the annoying barking was pitiful — poor Betsy the beagle was lonely, frantic for her family’s return.

If you’re new to puppyhood, it helps to know the basics: Fortunately, it isn’t too tricky. Here are the top five rules to being a good puppy neighbor:\n\n» Scoop the poop. Make a habit of cleaning up your puppy’s elimination the\n\nmoment they go to the bathroom. Aside from the obvious sanitation element, when your puppy is praised and sees you picking up their mess in the right location, they’re more likely to go there again.\n\n» Select the pooping place.

Though it’s tempting to want to walk your puppy as far from your home as possible, you wouldn’t potty- train a kid by sending them to the neighbors’ bathroom, right? Because dogs mark their boundaries (also known as their territory), make sure your puppy learns where their property begins and ends. If you let them potty around the ’hood, as they mature they may become more reactive or excitable on leash as puppies identify their territory by scent marking. If your puppy is the reactive type, they’ll likely be more reactive in the house as well, alerting when others pass your window.\n\n» Be mindful of barking. Waking up to a barking dog or puppy is no fun. Avoid letting your puppy out before 7 a.m. and after 9 p.m., or talk to your neighbor if you’re worried that the barking might be bothering their peace of mind.\n\nBarking puppies are not happy puppies. If yours is barking uncontrollably, consider their state: Could chewing a bone, engaging in some interactive play, or experiencing the pleasure of your company calm their worries?",

Barking can develop into a bothersome routine if you don’t get a quick, calm, and steady handle on it; see Chapter 15 for tips. Do your part in puppyhood to limit the startle reactions in your puppy by conditioning them to everyday noises — ranging from visits from delivery people to sounds just beyond the wall to neighbors passing by the front window. To do this, simply place treat cups in strategic locations so that when you hear a familiar noise or either you see or the puppy sees something beyond reach, you can quickly grasp the cup, shake it, and redirect your puppy to a chew toy or fun activity. Remember to move back and away from the center of the distraction. For more help on this issue, flip ahead to Chapter 15 and read up on curbing the barking habit.\n\nWhen leaving your puppy, put on some gentle music to drown out incoming sounds, dim the lights and close the blinds to block activity, and leave them with a satisfying chew toy.\n\nIf you leave your puppy outdoors, provide them with access to a shaded area and plenty of fresh water. If you’re expecting inclement weather, don’t leave your puppy alone outside. Go with them to their potty area and bring them directly back inside after they’re done.\n\nIf your puppy suffers from separation anxiety, they will suffer more if crated. Flip to that section in Chapter 16 for more tips on helping them cope when left alone.",

As your puppy is maturing, you may begin to walk them around the neighborhood, but make every effort to teach them considerate walking skills.\n\nStart by selecting a piece of compassion wear (either a front clip or head harness) to begin with, rather than affix your puppy to a neck collar and take them on a drag.\n\nTake five to seven short walks (no more than 5 minutes apiece) inside your home, teaching your puppy their first walking words: Follow-Wait-Find-It.\n\n» Follow: This word directs your puppy to follow your lead! Project your voice in the direction you want your puppy to follow and stop every few steps initially (gradually lengthening the steps you take) to stop your puppy as directed below.\n\n» Wait: This word teaches your puppy to stop, look, and listen to you. To teach it, stop suddenly, and quickly direct your puppy to Find It as outlined below. If your puppy doesn’t stay with you, hold a treat to their nose to get their attention, then say “wait” as you more gradually bring your pace to a halt. » Find It: As you come to a stop bring a treat to the floor by the side of your left shoe.

Though the puppy parent may insist that the dog is friendly, you just don’t know how the dog will react to a stranger. If you meet someone who is walking a friendly-looking puppy of a similar age, first ask whether you can approach to say hi. Respect the parent’s decision whatever it is and don’t take offense: The puppy may be sick or the person preoccupied or in a hurry.\n\nTeach walking skills on a 6-foot leash. Avoid using a retractable leash until you and your puppy have the hang of walking together. Never use retractable leashes near roadways or crowds — too dangerous.\n\n» Introducing your puppy to strangers, wild animals, noises, and interesting objects\n\nYour puppy is born to be social — that’s the good news. If introduced to\n\npeople and places during their socialization period, they’ll grow into a dog who can handle just about anything.

Older puppies who haven’t been socialized to take unfamiliar sounds and people in stride often go into a metaphoric tailspin and become dogs who are wary or defensive of new experiences for the rest of their lives. Being a scaredy-cat is no life for a dog, so devote the time early on (or hire a professional to do it for you) to get your pup acclimated to everything they will encounter throughout their life, from objects and people to noises and other animals.\n\nAll puppies need someone to look up to: Like kids, they’re eaily intimidated when they’re little. Though they idolize their birth mama, that attachment will transfer to you, and just like that, your puppy will be watching your interpretation of new people and experiences for guidance on how to react. This is the ideal bonding experience if you cop a been-there-done-that attitude. Stay calm, be confident (even if you have to pretend), and use lots of rewards to help your puppy see that life is nothing to fret over.\n\nIf your puppy is older than 16 weeks, don’t despair. Even though they have passed their ideal impression window, they’re still open to your example when they get overwhelmed or excited. A noticeably defensive or wary reaction simply indicates that your puppy has no conscious memory of such an occurrence and isn’t sure how to act. In these circumstances, your reactions to both the situation and the puppy are important.",

This chapter is here to help.\n\nMy favorite puppy quote is, to paraphrase Frederick Douglas, “It’s easier to build strong puppies than to repair broken dogs.”\n\nRecognizing the Critical Stages of Your Puppy’s Social Calendar\n\nSocializing your puppy to all of life’s surprises is just as important as training them during the first year. Though they may behave perfectly in your living room, if they fall to pieces when you hit the road, you won’t be able to take them anywhere. And your puppy has so much more in store for them than the usual distractions and people in your backyard. Exposing your puppy to different animals, weather situations, objects, noises, and places will encourage them to accept anything new throughout their life.\n\nPuppies, like children, go through developmental stages, and each stage brings with it a new perspective. In the earliest stages, everything is new, and your pup- py’s trust in you is innocent and faithful. This is the ideal time to get started. As long as you don’t react to a new stimulation, your puppy won’t, either — they’ll get conditioned to new noises, sights, and people, often without pause or hesitation.\n\nAs your puppy grows up, they’ll become less inhibited about how to act and will need persuading to stay focused on you. (Think food and fun here.) Here’s a list of puppyhood developmental stages; socialization ideally starts in the first days and weeks they’re born.",

Sure, they’re born blind and deaf (puppies’ eyes and ears open within four weeks of age) and can’t even potty without their moth- er’s stimulation, but at least their body is aware of temperature and motion. Devoted breeders start stimulating their puppies with a gentle touch from day one to prepare their pups for their eventual lives with people.\n\nAfter five weeks of containment, puppies explode into their first socialization period and learn from their mother and littermates what most kids pick up in kindergarten: In doggie terms, they learn about biting gently (what the pros call bite inhibition), respecting authority, and playing with an object to self-soothe. Unless you love a challenge (and I do mean a challenge), only adopt a puppy who has spent seven to eight weeks with their mother and littermates.\n\nSeven to 16 weeks is the period when your puppy’s brain grows, also called the critical socialization period, and for a good reason: Your puppy is creating mental pathways, learning routines, and developing habits that can last a lifetime; this is also the stage when your puppy will encode all the sights and sounds they will experience in their lifetime. That’s good if you expose them to lots of stuff, but not so good if you’re busy or you lose track of these most important weeks for your puppy. I’ll go over just how to socialize your puppy and tweak your response for different reactions (hyper, fearful, or defensive) later in this chapter, but suffice it to say that if you have a puppy, the time to start exposing them to just about everything is now.",

For example, an older puppy who hasn’t navigated a stair- case or hardwood floor may be terrified at the prospect. How you handle such a situation determines their future attitude. Help is just pages away.\n\nAs far as socialization goes, maturity is like a funnel: It’s right side up until about four or months old, at which time it inverts.

Smaller dogs have it all wrapped up by about a year; larger dogs can take as long as two years.

This can be a tremendously fun, adventurous, and explosive learning stage for both you and your puppy.\n\nDoes this mean you should just throw in the towel if you’ve adopted an older puppy or are reading this book after missing this window? Heavens, no. You’ll still have a lot of influence over your puppy’s interpretation of the situation, though less than if they were just a baby. For example, an older puppy who hasn’t navigated a staircase or hardwood floor may be terrified at the prospect. How you handle such a situation determines their future attitude. If a situation is avoided (rather than dealt with as I suggest), a puppy will mature into a dog who is permanently leery of stairs or whatever the phobia is throughout their lives. You don’t want that.",

Using the descrip- tions found in Chapter 6, see if you can determine whether your puppy is excita- ble, cautious, or defensive. The next few sections spell out how you should deal with each puppy type.\n\nExcitable puppies have little fear and want to explore everything and meet every- one.

(See Figure 9-1.) Scratch their chest, and reward and pet them for staying on all four paws.\n\n» Help them adopt an alternative greeting style: They might grab a toy and dash around like mad or flip over on their back for a belly rub, also known as “belly up!”\n\nAll puppies repeat behavior that wins them attention — they don’t care whether the interaction is negative or positive. As even a glance or light touch may be all that’s needed to guarantee a repeat performance, avoid pushing or verbal admon- ishments.

Avoid the temptation to bend and soothe your puppy, because they may consider your reaction as modeling their behavior. Instead, adopt a been-there-done-that attitude, acting courageous and calm. Approach whatever distraction has rattled your puppy and — when possible — pretend to sniff it curiously. As your puppy overcomes their initial reaction, use treats to reward their baby steps. Continue to expose them to whatever the new distraction is for three to five minutes each day until they absorb the distraction as blasé.\n\nCommit now to socializing the paws off a fearful-type puppy. However, remember that it may take many outings to mellow their caution to the point that they’ll become more pleasant to have around.\n\nDon’t lift your puppy or coddle them if they have a fearful reaction.

    "page_content": "Your puppy’s first thunderstorm or fireworks celebration may be a memorable event. The best thing you can do is act like it’s nothing — petting or soothing when your puppy is in a state of panic may model their fear, creating a panic reaction instead of what may initially have been just a normal caution response. Rather than model fear by crouching low, talking in a voice that sounds more like whining than confident reassurance, and staring at them in intense concern (your puppy may startle to being stared at this time), stay calm, use familiar directions, and keep your puppy with you. Here’s a helpful list of things to do when your puppy is unsettled by life’s unavoidable events:\n\nUse a leash in tandem with compassion wear. If your puppy has already devel- oped a fearful reaction to storms, use a leash affixed to your choice of compassion wear (see Chapter 5) to guide them through each episode rather than let them hide or run about in a state of panic.\n\nSet a good example. Put on soothing music and stay calm as you read or relax as if nothing is happening. If your puppy will eat, chew, or play with you, that’s a good sign: Offer them the opportunity. By staying calm and just reading a book or doing another low-key activity, you’re setting an example of how to act in a storm.\n\nUse a sound recording. If a specific sound is unsettling to your puppy, record it or see whether you can find a sound machine that has the sound prerecorded. Play it at gradually increasing volumes while your puppy is playing or eating. If they are still startled by the noise, lower the volume and play it in a distant room. If your puppy’s reactions don’t improve, speak to your veterinarian about medication.",

And if you discipline an anxious pup, they’ll become more stressed and destroy other items — perhaps your rug or the bed. Is this a sign of spite? No, never: puppies live in the moment and in moment’s like these your puppy is just confused and worried, and they need your help to adjust.

Line the bottom with a mat, cloth, or similar bedding to provide a surface that they can sink their paws into while you’re driving.\n\n» Secure your puppy with a seat belt. Give your puppy their area in the back seat for short jaunts. Secure a doggie-style attachment to the seat belt and decorate the area with a mat and toys to keep them comfortable and occupied during the drive.\n\n» Erect a sturdy barrier. Barriers enclose your puppy in the back compartment\n\nThe Center for Pet Safety rates different items, such as toys, bones, and car safety harnesses. Check out the site before you buy any of these items: www.centerforpetsafety.org.\n\nCars can be a dangerous place for dogs, so you must take certain precautions:",

Keep the second set of keys with you so that you can get back into the car. » Think careful, not cool. While driving, keep windows cracked but not wide\n\nopen. Some people think that letting a dog hang their head out the window is cool, but it’s dangerous. Dogs can get hurled from the car in an accident or have debris fly into their eyes, causing permanent damage.\n\nAre you planning a long journey?

A change can upset\n\ntheir system, and that’s one discomfort you can easily avoid.\n\n» Avoid traveling in extreme heat unless you have a good air-conditioning system.

    "page_content": "Many people picture bringing a puppy home during the “adorable” stage,\n\nbetween 8 and 14 weeks, and professionals do claim that it’s the best age to bond with a puppy. Though I agree that it’s an impressionable time, the truth is that you can bond with a puppy (or a dog, for that matter) at any age. It’s fun to watch a puppy morph through each developmental stage, but puppies are a lot of work, too; this chapter helps you get a focus on just what’s in store.\n\nSome breeders offer their puppy buyers what’s known as imprinting foster care after a puppy separates from their litter at seven or eight weeks old. This service involves paying someone else to house-train, socialize, and teach your puppy for weeks to months, depending on the arrangement. I’ve seen this work well for some of my clients and not so well for others: Much depends on who’s doing the foster care. The choice is up to you.\n\nBefore giving birth to my first child, I anticipated snuggly cuddles and long, lin- gering morning gazes — the two of us blissfully smothered in mutual adoration. Little did I know. The first months were in fact a blur of late-night crying jags, poopy diapers, and wishing that someone had prepared me for the labor involved in parenting. If you’re a new puppy owner or you’re preparing to bring home a puppy, let me help you out: At the stage between 8 and 14 weeks, your puppy is all about getting familiar with their surroundings and routines. Don’t expect too much from them. Even though a puppy at this age is capable of learning, their brain won’t finish developing until they’re 14 weeks old.",

    "page_content": "So, what can you really expect? First and foremost, puppies at this stage need tons of sleep: between 16 and 18 hours of quiet time. If you’re tempted to overstimulate your young puppy, don’t do it. Your puppy will end up acting like a colicky baby who is chronically sleep deprived. How can you tell? Puppies who need sleep act fidgety, pushy, and mouthy. Unless they get the right kind of sleep, overtired pup- pies develop into restless dogs — and you don’t want that.\n\nNor do you want to start off on the wrong foot when it comes to socializing your puppy. The most important lessons at this stage involve associating words with specific routines. Luckily for you, these lessons aren’t hard to teach. If you stay consistent, the associations should develop naturally as you tend to your puppy’s everyday needs. I outline just how to tackle this task in the following sections, so put the high-intensity exercise and training lessons on the back burner for now. If you’re disappointed that your puppy won’t be running that fancy doggy parkour obstacle course just yet, try not to be — there’s still a lot of fun to be had at this stage.\n\nAll puppies are programmed to look to their family’s body language and postures for clues on how to act, as I discuss in Chapter 6. Your first goal is to teach your puppy to listen for direction by outlining lessons similar to teaching a foreigner a new language. Using a say-n-show format, you’ll say words that tie into where you’re going or what your puppy is doing. When you pair words with action, your puppy will learn to listen for direction in no time.",

    "page_content": "Like a human baby, your puppy is paying attention to you all the time, absorbing everything going on around them at a rate never to be equaled again in their life- time. Young and impressionable, they look to others to learn how to handle new\n\nsituations. But they can’t understand what you’re teaching them until they learn to identify the meaning of certain words. After all, training isn’t an exercise in domination or control; it’s teaching English to your puppy so that you share a common language.\n\nTaking care of your puppy at this stage can be a little repetitive: it’s a continuous string of sleep-potty-eat-drink-potty-play-potty-sleep-potty — and then rinse and repeat. Bonding during this stage occurs as you calmly and routinely take care of these basic needs: Yes, those needs in fact involve eating, drinking, pottying, sleeping, and playing. Help your puppy learn their first words by teaching them where to go and what to do when all their needs are pressing. Your puppy desper- ately wants to know, “Where do I go when I am thirsty, hungry, or tired or need to potty?”\n\nYour puppy at this stage needs lots of potty breaks because their bladder muscles don’t fully develop until four to five months of age. For more on house-training your puppy, flip to Chapter 14.\n\nWith consistent routines, schedules, and word cues, your puppy will start indicat- ing their needs by initiating the routines you’ve shown them! (For printable puppy schedules, visit my website at SarahSaysPets.com.\n\nIn Table 10-1, I list five important routines your puppy should know at this stage, pairing each one with a word cue to help them link each routine with a specific action.",

Settle them in with a busy toy or chew to help them self-soothe. Avoid dragging them, pleading, feeling guilty, or getting cross.\n\nEach time you feed your puppy — whether by hand, bowl, or feeding toy — identify the activity with a word and routinely go to the same area to get their food. If they jump or bark, stop and walk away. Only feed a calm puppy.\n\nKeep your puppy’s water dish in the same area. Have them hold still before lowering the bowl.\n\nHelp your puppy identify their belongings by keeping their toys and bones in one area. Identify each object as you play with it.\n\nYour puppy will learn more quickly if training is incorporated into everyday habits and playtime. Use their name and directions like Sit and Find it as you share treats and food and play with toys. Your number-one routine will be to teach them where to go to the bathroom, as I discuss in Chapter 14.\n\nForget discipline at this stage because your pup is just too young to understand it. You succeed only in frightening them and eroding your relationship — and that’s not good.\n\nThis game is easy and fun and you’ll use it forever. Take a few kibbles, as outlined in Chapter 20, and drop them at your feet (gently at first), saying Find it. It’s that simple. How many repetitions does it take to teach your puppy this cue? With each Find It treat-drop, they’re one step closer to learning this all-important word game.",

You can also use Find It to keep greetings with strangers on an even keel and teach cooperative leash walking skills.\n\nUse Find It when feeding your puppy. Toss one kibble at a time (a great game for children) as you encourage the 4-paw rule as detailed later, in the section “Help- ing your puppy learn the 4-paw rule,” or toss a few handfuls down for meal- time fun.\n\nTreat cups (see Chapter 5) help your puppy learn their name quickly. If your puppy has yet to associate the sound of the cup shaking with receiving a food treat, prac- tice shaking and rewarding until they do. Now make multiple cups and spread them around for easy access. When you’re ready to have your puppy learn their name, follow this 3-step process:\n\n1. Shake the cup and say the puppy’s name simultaneously. 2. Repeat until you get a quick response each time you call.\n\nUse this trick everywhere you spend time so your puppy will alert each time you call out.\n\n3. Call out their name first, immediately followed by a shake of the cup.\n\nOnce your puppy is alerting to their name and no cup is immediately neces- sary, begin Step 3.\n\n4. Call out the puppy’s name and progressively extend the time you shake the cup.\n\nGo from 1 second later to 2, 3, and 4 seconds later until you see that your puppy has learned their name. Gradually phase out shaking the cup, but continue rewarding your puppy with play, praise, and other rewards, like letting them play.",

    "page_content": "Pick a short name or nickname and say it anytime you’re offering your puppy positive rewards, like treats, toys, or attention.\n\nTeaching your puppy to sit is like teaching a child to say please. You can’t teach your puppy to literally say please, but you can get them to use a gesture to say that they want something. If you consistently direct your puppy to sit before offering them anything they perceive as positive, they’ll sit when they want something just as readily as most dogs jump. Here are some situations where you want your puppy to say please:\n\n» When receiving meals, treats, or water » Before a ball toss or toy offering » Before doors open to let them in or out » Whenever they want an item on the counter or tabletop » Before car entrances and exits » During all greetings » During introductions to children and older people\n\nMake sure your puppy doesn’t generalize a learned routine, like Sit, to one spot, such as their place or your kitchen. Practice new routines in a variety of different places and around various people and situations.\n\nTeach your puppy that the word Come means you’re together, not apart. Eventu- ally, it will bring your puppy running from afar, but initially Come should reflect\n\ntouch, reassurance, and rewards, not separation and frustration. Here’s how to do it:\n\n1. Hold a treat in one hand. Hold the other hand open, palm out, 2 to 3 inches from your puppy’s nose. The instant your puppy touches their nose to your palm, say Come and drop the reward from the other hand, saying Find it!

The goal is to teach your puppy that “Give” means “spit it out.” This action highlights your good intentions to play and not steal.\n\nYou can use a treat cup to encourage sharing. When your puppy has an object or a toy, shake the cup enthusiastically and say Give when they do.\n\nPractice these directions in the confines of a small room for five days, and then bring the direction into normally populated areas. Phase out the treats gradually. If your intention is to toss the toy, take it after they spit it out and toss it imme- diately. Praise them with an exclamation like this: “Good boy — let’s play!”\n\nEarlier in this chapter, I tell you about the importance of associating words with everyday routines; Table 10-1 gives some examples of phrases to use. The list of words you can use to identify your routines is endless, however. For example, you can teach your puppy the names of each room in your house, if you want to, or the name of each and every toy.\n\nWhatever phrase you choose, teach your puppy using the say-n-show format: Say the word and do the action. Reward your puppy for following along.

It’s especially important to impress on puppies at this stage the impor- tance of the rule. Your puppy’s first lessons simply must include not jumping for treats, toys, or attention. Using the 4-paw rule (no notice or greeting or reward unless all four paws are on the floor) is easy at this stage. Every time your puppy jumps up at the gate to get attention or jumps during greetings, stop dead in your tracks and cover your face with your hands — a technique I refer to as the peeka- boo solution. (The idea here is to ostentatiously deny them the attention they seek.) If they jump for treats or toys, lift them out of reach. In all these situations, wait until your puppy is on all four paws to give them what they want.",

Some larger-breed puppies, although big enough to use stairs, are afraid because their depth perception is only begjinning to develop around eight weeks of age.\n\nIf you have a puppy with stair phobia, help them walk the stairs, by wrapping your hands around their ribs and guiding them down slowly. A helper can crouch down to their level and shake a treat cup to cheer them on.\n\nIn Chapter 7, I talk about how you should set up your puppy’s free-play area. Start teaching your puppy their “place” ASAP — by putting a washable mat in a corner and arranging their toys and bowls nearby it. Teach your puppy the word Place by waving a toy or shaking a treat cup as you guide them to their area. Reward them after they have all four paws on the mat — good puppy! Should your puppy go on their mat on their own, keep treats handy to reward them.\n\nIn Chapter 14, I talk about how you can teach your puppy to ring a bell when they need to go outside to potty. The fact is, though, that your puppy can learn to ring a bell to get whatever they want. Hang one by the water dish to ensure that they stay hydrated, and by the doors so that they can alert you whenever they need to potty or want to come back inside. Tap the bell gently with your fingers just before you fill the water bowl or open the door — soon, your puppy will catch on and ring it, too.",

It’s a survival instinct that may play out if you insist on forcibly walking your young puppy on a tight leash. If you do, they may buck, freeze up, bite through the leash, or yelp as though they were caught in a bear trap. Worst of all, when forced to yield to a leash, a puppy grows up instinctively pulling in an attempt to break free, and will bolt given the opportunity.\n\nIt’s okay to place a lightweight collar or harness on your puppy soon after you get them home. If they’re like most puppies, they’ll fuss at first by scratching at their neck or rolling on the floor. If they do, condition their cooperation by placing it on before meals or for 20-minute intervals while you play Find It or toss favorite toys. Does your puppy run from you or back up when you approach to place their collar/harness on them? If so, kneel or pick them up first, use a spreadable treat or crumbly treat that you can place on the ground, and then place the item from behind your puppy.\n\nPuppies grow fast, so keep an eye on the collar size and loosen it when necessary.",

Once that’s happening with ease, start to call your puppy’s name and encourage them to follow you.\n\nDo any number of foolish things to pique your puppy’s interest. When they start following you, reward them by placing the treats on the floor and saying “Find It-Follow.”\n\nIf your puppy actively resists following you, don’t run over to them; doing that reinforces the resistance. Instead, wave rewards or lower yourself to the floor while you praise them.\n\nThroughout your puppy’s life, they’ll be prodded, pinched, and probed for good (though unclear to them) reasons. To get your puppy used to all of life’s surprises, practice the handling exercises in this section early and often. No one would wish a cut on a puppy’s paw, a burn from an electrical cord, or a double ear infection, but these things do happen, and it helps to get your puppy prepared. (I talk more about health concerns and emergency issues in the chapters in Part 5.)\n\nHere’s a handling tip your veterinarian will love: Once a day, take out some savory food bits or a spreadable treat, and — while your puppy is cheerfully eating — play doggie-doctor. Use household objects to pretend with or scare up a toy doc- tor’s kit as you gently give your puppy make-believe shots, look in their ears and eyes, probe their belly, and so on.

Handle and touch your puppy’s paws daily to ensure that future nail clipping, routine check-ups (for thorns or cuts after adventuring), and any future medical care their paws might need is a non-issue.\n\nA brand-new puppy is easy to condition and socialize because they’re unsure of themselves and how best to react to new situations. Most puppies look to their people to direct and translate new situations. How you greet and interact with people from all walks of life are their greatest examples.\n\nWhen welcoming new visitors, allow your puppy to approach them on their terms rather than thrust them forward or lift them excitedly. If your puppy is unsure, let them hang back, and encourage your visitors to wait for them to approach them.\n\nOf course, the best lesson in appropriate greeting manners comes from you. Mom was right again when she said, “Good manners start at home.” When greeting your puppy, be casual. Even though you may be beside yourself with delight, stay calm and interact with your puppy only when they’re calm, too.\n\nAs the weeks pass, your puppy will feel more a part of your household and be more interactive when new situations arise. If your puppy begins to jump or mouth you or your company, kneel next to them and brace them by clipping your thumb gen- tly under their collar. (See Chapter 9 for an illustration.)

During this stage, puppies are beginning to recognize what behaviors get your attention, what games seem to last the longest (and not necessarily the games you want to play), and who’s organizing the day-to-day interactions — in their eyes, it may not be you. Even though your puppy may act pretty confident during this phase, they still need direction from you. The advice in this chapter can help you guide your puppy successfully through their preadolescence.\n\nPuppies emerge from their sleepy, early brain-growth phase with eagerness and enthusiasm for all of life’s many adventures. Your efforts will boil down to helping your puppy understand where to go and what to do in every situation. Say you’re\n\nsitting at the table or texting a friend or welcoming a visitor or waiting your turn at the vet’s office: Where should your puppy go and what should they do? How about when they’re bored or hungry or wants to play? If you don’t direct them, they’ll test out all the typical preadolescent shenanigans, including jumping, nip- ping, barking, and grabbing-’n’-going. It can be an utter nightmare.\n\nFortunately, this chapter provides a happy alternative to this type of nightmare. If you follow my advice here, you’ll end up surviving — and maybe even enjoying — your puppy’s preadolescence. With my tried-and-true sequencing approach, you’ll be able to introduce your puppy to three cues at a time. You’ll then be able to use those words to help your puppy understand where to go and what to do in every situation.",

Your puppy will cherish their time with you, and lessons that help them identify words and end with rewards build a positive team spirit.\n\nBecause your preadolescent puppy has neither the attention span nor impulse control of a 7-month-old dog, the lessons in this chapter are tailored to meet your puppy’s capacities at the 14-weeks-to-6-months stage. Taken altogether, they allow your puppy to be successful, mastering each direction before you start applying it to their daily routine — similar to letting children master their addi- tion skills in school before asking them to balance your checkbook.\n\nPuppies, like kids, love plunging into group activities. The behavior they repeat is determined by what gets your attention, so focus only on the routines you want your puppy to repeat. Is your puppy over on their mat, chewing a bone? Stand up — quick! Race over and reward them for doing just that.\n\nI suggest that you practice each of the lessons outlined in this chapter twice daily for five to ten minutes per lesson (shorter lessons for younger puppies). As you practice, you may notice that your puppy picks up some directions faster than others. Don’t be too surprised. That’s how training usually goes. After all, think of what you’re accomplishing: You’re teaching another species your language. My advice is to be patient throughout the many phases because puppies learn best from an understanding teacher.",

(More about walkabouts later in this chapter.) As they grow more comfortable with your surroundings, rather than burst out of their confinement and barrel through your home — grabbing every roll of toilet paper, stuffed animal, or sock they find in their way — you may gradually trust them with more freedom. Don’t rush it, though. If they do well for the most part but falls apart when company arrives, put them on the leash whenever you have visitors.\n\nAt this stage, your puppy should feel pretty confident in knowing where to go to get their basic needs met (eat, drink, sleep, potty, and play). If you’ve not outlined these routines, review the Needs Chart (Table 6-2) from Chapter 6 and the tips in Chapter 10. During preadolescence, however, your puppy will be far more interested in how they fit into the fabric of your everyday life. If you don’t tell them where to go and what to do, they will turn your life upside down by making their own set of rules — and that’s a nightmare I wouldn’t wish on anybody.\n\nAs your puppy is developing, both physically and mentally, you need to start teaching the following useful directions: Follow, Sit, Down, Stand Still, Stay, and Come. Though you may have already started some of these lessons, continue rein- forcing them throughout your puppy’s development. Build your lessons around their regular nap times (in the middle of the day), and don’t forget to intersperse the lessons with plenty of play and socialization.",

Because playtime is every puppy’s top priority during this stage, the following list highlights which directions to use during each game. (To find instructions on how to play a particular game, flip to Chapter 20.)\n\n» Can’t Catch Me: Use your puppy’s name to attract their attention as you’re running away from them, and use the directions Wait and Find It when you stop abruptly to reward them. If your puppy jumps up, lift the treat high above their head until they are standing securely on all four paws.\n\n» Get Your Toy: When playing with your puppy’s toys, gather multiples so that you are never caught focusing on just one. Toss one toy, saying “Get Your Toy” and cheering your puppy on if they run after the toy. If your puppy returns to you, pair the cue \"Bring\" with their delivery, but don’t reach out or immedi- ately demand that they fork it over to you: Remember, puppies like kids need to learn how to share! If you can inspire their sharing the toy by offering a treat or baiting them with a new toy so they spit out the one they’re holding, say Give as they spit it out.\n\n» Belly Up: Anytime your puppy naturally lies down, say Down.

To control their exuberance, or to help your puppy should a sudden noise or activity startle them, get a handle on these lessons as soon as you’re able.\n\nYour puppy’s ability to hold still for any length of time depends on their age as well as on how you introduce this lesson. At first, keep the lessons short and completely food-centered as you practice in a low-commotion environment. Work with your puppy off-leash or on a light freedom line if they’re easily distracted. Practice at a time when they are neither exhausted nor ready for play — it’s what I call the sweet spot of ideal focus. (All I can say is that you’ll know it when you find it.) Read the steps in the following sections, and visualize the exercise before getting started.\n\nAll puppies are born posturing, and they focus quickly on learning by way of signs and gestures. Though you’ll want to teach your puppy to listen for your direction, using sig- nals to reinforce your words can speed the learning along. As a bonus? A puppy who learns to read signals may watch you more attentively.\n\nDirect your signals just above your puppy’s nose or muzzle. Here are the signals you use in this chapter:",

Sit: Hold the treat from your puppy’s nose, bringing it to a point directly above their ears. As they sit, say Sit.\n\n2. Down: Hold the treat from your puppy’s nose, drawing it straight down to a spot directly between their paws. When they lie down, say Down. (See Figure 11-2.)\n\n3. Stand: Hold the treat from your puppy’s nose, drawing it out in a line directly in front of their eye, or if they are lying down, draw it at a slightly upward angle in front of their face. (See Figure 11-3)\n\nYour puppy may have an easier time learning one skill than another: That’s com- mon. Or, you may feel like you’re not able to move your puppy from one position to another without physically pushing them along with your free hand. Ideally, give your puppy time (sometimes it takes 30 seconds) to move into each position on their own.

If they continue to jump at you, ask a helper to hold the line loosely and to tug it downward should your puppy leap up.\n\nCome is one of the first directions all puppies should know. Though I introduce it in Chapter 10, it bears repeating that Come should be taught as a cue that means you are together, not apart. During this preadolescent stage, practice Come as a sequence with other words to help your puppy understand that Come is a direction that leads to interactive fun. Here’s how:",

Convey that Come invites reconnection and that togetherness is the safest, most wonderful place to be.\n\nWhether you have kids around or you’re a kid at heart, the Over-Under-Through sequence is just plain fun. It also helps to teach your puppy self-control whenever people are sitting at their level:\n\n1. Get a handful of treats and sit on the floor with your legs side-by-side and extended out in front of you.\n\n2.

Saying Good Dog! repetitively in a high-pitched tone may create so much excitement that your puppy may abandon their good behavior for something more recreational, such as nipping or jumping. Instead of lots of verbal praise, if you’re using a clicker, click before you treat. (See Chapter 5 for more on clickers.) If you’re not using a clicker, use a sharp, marking word like Yes or Good to highlight the exact behavior you want your puppy to repeat.\n\nTurning your young puppy free in your home, even if they’ve been doing well with their potty training, is a big mistake. They’ll misbehave and you’ll end up paying for it — in more ways than one. Unsupervised, a puppy can rearrange your closets, eat garbage, and chew on the chairs.\n\nIf your end game is to teach your puppy how to be free in your home, however, this is an ideal time to get started.\n\nOnce or twice a day, lead your puppy through your home on-leash.

Direct with the familiar words Follow, Wait, Sit, Place, and Leave It that you’ve been teaching them and reward their cooperation with treats and praise.\n\n» Speak directions clearly, and enunciate syllables. Also, give directions only once; repeated directions sound drastically different from single directions. (Consider the indecipherable “Sitsitsitcomeonpleasesitdown.”)\n\n» If you’re sitting, arrange a place for your puppy and settle them with a\n\nchew. If they can settle down, keep them with you.\n\nWhen your puppy gets into a routine in your home, you can test their self-control and cooperation by letting them drag a freedom leash as described in Chapter 5. Use your words and signals to direct them, guide them to their stations if you want them to be still, and pick up the lead if they get rambunctious or needs reminding.\n\nEstablishing a special place in the rooms you share\n\nAll puppies love to follow their families, and, when given a choice, yours will always want to be near you. Too much isolation is a bad thing because a puppy gleans their personality from group reflection. When possible, teach your puppy their special place in each of the rooms you share so that they can hang with you wherever you are in your home. If your puppy is still working on their house- training or instigates mayhem when given too much freedom, either walk them on a leash or tether them, as shown in Figure 11-4.",

Until this age, most puppies feel frantically trapped on a leash and need more sleep than active training. Before then, supervision, crate time, and safe-room freedom are best.\n\nTether when you can supervise and teach Stay.\n\nDetermining how long you can keep your puppy tethered to their special place depends on their age and mental state at the time. A sleepyhead of any age can handle an hour or more, and an older pup can handle more extended periods. The best gauge is your puppy’s behavior — always keep them tethered near you and be aware of their signals. If your pup has been resting by you for an hour and sud- denly stands up and starts acting restless, they probably need to go to their potty spot. If your puppy chews on a bone for 15 minutes and then starts acting like a jumping bean, they’re likely experiencing an energy spurt and needs time for a little play.\n\nWhen creating tethers for your puppy, follow these steps:\n\n1. Select a station area in each room you share — perhaps a spot near the couch in the TV room but away from the table in the dining room.\n\nPuppies fidget, so make sure the station is away from stairs, electrical cords and outlets, and other entanglements.\n\n2. Set up the area with a comfy mat and your puppy’s favorite chew toy.\n\nDoing so helps them identify their special place — their comfort station. Think of the comfort station in human terms: When you go into your living room, don’t you have a favorite couch or chair?",

Though Chapter 17 addresses grooming tips and techniques, I thought I should stress at least once in this chapter the importance of conditioning your puppy to their grooming tools now — the sooner you get started, the more they will link their sprucing to food and fun.\n\nHere are three tools to introduce your puppy to. Use favorite chews, spreadable treats, and high-value food rewards to get your puppy acclimated to their use:\n\n» Toothbrush: Organize a routine around the tooth-brushing event to build\n\nexcitement for the activity. I always brush each of our dog’s teeth separately in the small downstairs bathroom to build up eagerness for each turn.\n\nSandwich a dab of safely formulated doggie paste between your chosen brush and a high-value food treat. Say Pearly Whites as you extend the brush to your puppy. After they alert to the routine, continue to play the game for a few more days, slowly diminishing the size of the food treat. Ask a partner to steady your puppy’s head by holding a treat to their nose as you get them comfortable having the brush rotated in their mouth.\n\n» Nail and hair clippers: This is an excellent time to get your puppy used to the\n\nsound of any future clipping tools you or your groomer will use in your puppy’s lifetime. It bears repeating that preadolescent puppies are more receptive to noises as well as to any handling or unfamiliar physical interac- tions than at any other time in their lives. Pairing handling with positive outcomes becomes forever lodged in the area of their brain labeled It Must Be Okay Just Because It Leads to Something Good.",

Condition your puppy to their presence as outlined with the clipper, but extend the practice to gently touching their coat. Remember to reward them after you remove the object. Gradually comb through their coat, removing the object often to reward their cooperation.\n\nYour puppy “sees” the world through their sense of smell, so let them sniff every- thing that comes near their body.

As I stress throughout this book — and even more so at this particu- lar stage in your puppy’s life — keep your cool. Sure, your puppy may act like a stranger at times, but they still identify with you and adore you most of all. This chapter will help you appreciate your puppy’s changing priorities and coach them through this awkward time. Together, you’ll not only discover how to survive this time but also how to thrive with everyone’s dignity intact.\n\nStarting the training process with an older puppy? Flip to Chapter 11 to learn the early lessons you missed.\n\nAt the teenage stage, your puppy’s world is being shaped by two conflicting forces: the desire to please you and the desire for some independence.

Puberty, which hap- pens during the teenage stage, results in the release of adult dog hormones that dramatically shape and modify your puppy’s mannerisms. Many parents report what you’ll experience: a cheerfully cooperative puppy suddenly blowing you off; a get-along-with-everyone puppy terrorizing the new pooch at the dog park; and what in the world do you call that thing they’re doing on the couch cushions — a pelvic thrust? Oh, the things you have to look forward to.\n\nBefore your puppy strays too far off course, make a list of all the good puppy man- ners you expect from your darling and share it with friends and family. Insist on\n\nfollowing through with expectations, and refuse to settle for any new ideas, lest friends and family develop their own set of rules.

A word cue can be attached to the action, which a puppy will learn over time.\n\nReward: Anything that a puppy values (freedom, a toy or bone, playtime, release from a crate or car) may be used to reward them for listening or responding to a signal.\n\nBribe: Bribes (generally, food) are used to cajole after a puppy has ignored a direction.\n\nThough lures are good for early training and rewards for good behavior can be given at any time, bribes are a big no-no unless you want a puppy who listens only when you’re waving a big piece of chicken in your hand.\n\nAs your puppy moves from preadolescent puppy lessons into the next phase of their learning, you’ll notice a few new things — namely, that your puppy is pro- cessing a lot more information than just “them” and “you.” Suddenly, that other dog barking in the distance has a crucial message that needs translation and often an immediate response, the vehicles zooming by take a form that elicits their developing predatory impulses, and, when given a choice, they’d often rather stay at the dog park than come home with you.\n\nThe good news is that your puppy will still excite to their old word cues if you keep the lessons fresh, and may work even harder to please you if you come up with new fun routines. Bring your lessons out into the real world, phase out your treat dependency, and engage your puppy’s focus by rewarding them with anything they consider positive, from playing with their dog friends to a swim in the lake.",

When you return to your puppy’s side at the end of\n\neach exercise, vary the length of time you pause before you release them with “Okay!” This variation prevents their “reading” the pattern and encourages them to keep a more watchful eye on your whereabouts.\n\n» Resist petting. Hold off until you finish the entire lesson. Praise is better —\n\ndo that with your voice.

If, after three to five paces, your puppy is walking with you, stop as you say “Wait,” and then reward them by placing a treat next to your left foot.\n\n5.

The best thing to do is to stop. Relax your arm straight on the leash and think of your elbow as a hinge. Rock it back slightly to offer the slightest give and hold your puppy in place until they stop pulling. The very moment your puppy stops pulling, looks back to you, or sits in place, mark the moment with a happy exclamation like “Good” (or use a clicker, if you have one) and place their food reward by your left foot.\n\nIs your puppy too strong for you to manage? Consider a conditioning harness or head collar, mentioned in Chapter 5. You can hold the leash behind your back with both hands. This position transfers the strain of the leash from your arms to the trunk of your body. If your puppy hacks or strains harder, however, call a profes- sional for assistance.

Pretend that my hand is there and that you’re trying to hit it.\n\nAs your puppy follows more willingly, play the pace-change game to keep them interested. Holding your leash hand steady, move faster by trotting. Then slow your pace by lengthening your stride. Make sure you change gears smoothly, and indicate the change by saying “Click-click” or “Shh.” Remember, your puppy’s a canine, not a Porsche.\n\nAfter you have your puppy walking to your rhythm, you’re ready to teach them the turns. Walking at a reasonable speed, say “Follow” and pivot to the right. To help your puppy keep up, slow down as you turn. Click your tongue, bend your knees, or slap your leg to keep them with you. Walk six paces, stop and position the Sit, and then hug your puppy for a job well done.\n\nAvoid pulling the puppy through the turn. That’s no fun for them.\n\nYou’ll know you’re ready to practice the Follow direction in everyday situations when your puppy responds without pressure on their collar. One obvious place to use the Follow direction is on your walks. If your puppy’s young or just beginning to learn, practice Follow for one-fourth of your walk.

If you have this problem, determine whether you’re asking too much too soon and check to see whether you’re using the right collar. (See Chapter 5.) Maybe your puppy needs to exercise more before you practice in public.\n\nAs you’re walking, you will pass other dogs and people. Though it’s okay to let your puppy greet some dogs and some people, they should not greet everyone. You need to be the one to judge whom to approach. Dog people are easy to identify: They look lovingly on your puppy as if just one pat will make their whole day. If you have the time, ask your puppy to Wait and Sit. Only after you have them set- tled should you allow them to go and greet a new person.\n\nIf you see another dog, well, that’s another matter. You need to make super-sure that any dog you approach has good leash manners and is dog-friendly. Unless you know the dog, you may not be able to tell; in this case, it’s better to teach your\n\npuppy the phrase not now, speeding up as you pass the other dog and discouraging your puppy from making any direct eye contact with passing dogs.\n\nIf you know an oncoming dog and want to stop to allow some on-leash interac- tion, you may certainly do so. Ask your puppy to Wait and Sit, however, before releasing them to greet.\n\nAllowing your puppy to drag you over to greet another dog is foolish and unsafe. Leashes modify a dog’s natural posture, making them look confrontational even when they’re anything but; also if your puppy were to break free from the leash, they would impulsively take off, putting themselves and others in danger!",

Using a sequence lesson format, Chapter 11 also shows you how to teach three words simultaneously and how to vary the order of the words you use in order to perfect your puppy’s listening skills. This chapter asks you to put their understanding to the test by using their words out in the real world and teaching them to listen, no matter the distance between you.\n\nContinue using the Wait direction to catch your puppy’s attention at doorways, cars, or stairs or before entering an area of high stimulation (for example, the veterinarian’s office, a room full of children, or a dog training class).

Hold the leash securely if your pup doesn’t stop with you. 3. Release with “Okay.” On a freedom line\n\n1. Position yourself next to the line, initially ten inches behind your puppy’s tail.\n\n3.

This section tells you what you need to know.\n\nYour puppy will not only feel different during this stage of maturity — but will also smell different. Of course, you and I might not notice, but other dogs are another story. It’s a time of heavy sniffing — your puppy will be like a debutant at the new ball of life.",

Since then, however, the equations have gotten a little more complicated. It turns out that puppies mature a lot during their first couple of years and then slow down considerably as they grow older. A quick search online (type “age equivalents in dogs”) will show the lifespan of a dog and their age equivalent, which varies even more, depending on your puppy’s size. Suffice it to say that simple math won’t help you here.\n\nThe good news for you is that all the drama of your puppy’s growth and emotional development should pass in a year instead of the decades it takes human kids to grow up. If you’ve done your work together as outlined in the other training chapters of Part 3, you’ll be able to communicate with your puppy using the words they know and routines that should be habituated by this stage. If you’re jumping into the book here, flip back to Chapters 10 and 11 to start your lessons off on the right paw!\n\nMagic happens if you routinely train your puppy through the various stages of learning. In addition to watching your puppy’s awareness grow, you will witness habits take form. Your puppy sits at the door because that’s what they’ve always done; they ring a bell when they need to potty, because that’s just the order of events, they drop the ball, fetch a toy when greeting, whip their head around when you call because it’s, well, that’s just how life works. It’s how it’s always been.",

Start there and master those exercises before you begin the ones described below.\n\nWhether your goal is to have your puppy off-lead around the home or to be responsive when you’re on a hike at a park (check the rules to ensure that you’re allowed to take your dog off-leash in a public area), the most considered question is, “How will I know when my puppy and I are ready for off-lead-control train- ing?” Well, there’s no magic age or season or day; readiness is something you gauge by experience. If you practice giving these directions and your pup shows signs of stress (such as licking their lips, hyperactivity, nipping or roughly jump- ing at you, chewing on their freedom lines), they’ve given you a signal to lower your expectations for now. Puppies show readiness with concentrated eye contact and responsiveness that’s quick and cooperative. A puppy has their timetable for preparedness: Off-lead work requires impulse control that emerges anytime between the ages of 6 and 18 months. Read on to get started.\n\nTraining off the leash requires that both you and your puppy be mentally prepared for the challenges you’ll face. Get your game face on, and then prepare your pup.\n\nTo have off-lead control, you must be confident that your puppy will listen. If you’re a bundle of nerves when you let go of the leash, your puppy will know it and\n\nwill become anxious and unresponsive. Puppies, like people, are drawn to confidence, so you need to act with authority and self-assurance even if you have to fake it.",

Off-lead control means continually reading and rereading your puppy — especially in the beginning — and being aware that your puppy is also learning about you. To have control, you must look like a con- fident parent so that your dog can trust your judgment.\n\nTo further your mental preparation, keep these three suggestions in mind:\n\n» Stay cool. Frustration makes you look foolish. As you work toward off-lead control, your puppy may act confused and unresponsive because your guidance is gone. You used to give the direction and guide them with the lead. Now you don’t, and it feels awkward to them. Whatever your pup’s reaction, stay cool. Any attempts at discipline add to their confusion. Jazz up your body language and use some pep talks to encourage them to stay focused on whatever you’re doing.\n\n» Stay focused. You want your puppy to grow up thinking their activities",

If your puppy can turn your day upside down by stealing a sock from the laundry basket, or toilet paper from the bathroom, or muffins off the counter, then you’re the one living in the dog house! Sure, most puppies will try to get all the attention by doing things that get you riled up, but aim to be a calm voice of reason and redirection. Work in a confined area or let your puppy drag a freedom line so that you can ignore or redirect your puppy when they act up.\n\n» Allow one step back for two steps forward. Your puppy is responding beautifully off-lead . . . until someone rings the doorbell, a chipmunk runs across the driveway, or another dog comes trotting past the gate. Then everything they’ve learned goes out the window and you’re back to being ignored. Let me tell you a secret: Off-lead control takes time. If your puppy is good but is still having trouble in a stimulating situation, review on-lead exercises in distracting environments. (See Chapter 12.) Using a freedom line helps control the situation and at the same time conditions more appropriate behavior.\n\nSo, what goes into making your pup mentally ready? Maturity serves your off-lead goals well. As your puppy passes into doghood, you’ll note calm predictability. Wanderlust and mischief will have most likely lost their thrill. Your dog’s joy will manifest itself in silent teamwork and shared activities. The stages your puppy follows to maturity aren’t so different from the ages and stages of a child growing into adulthood.",

For example, a terrier, who was bred to follow their hunting instincts indepen- dently, is far less impressed with your direction than a Shetland sheepdog, who lives for the camaraderie and guidance of a shepherd. Hounds and Nordic breeds are other pups who must be monitored closely because their instincts can override your direction. Do some research to discover whether your puppy’s breed was bred to work in concert with people or to work independently. Independent thinkers may need more persuasion to focus. (A clicker and some food can work wonders.) With an independent thinker, understand that 100 percent reliability may not be a realistic goal.\n\nBuying the Right Equipment — and Using It Correctly\n\nAs you work toward off-lead obedience, you’ll practice exercises that extend your control over greater and greater distances. Before you start, however, you should round up the following items (each of which is discussed in more detail later in this section):\n\n» Retractable leash: The retractable leash is invaluable for advanced\n\n» Indoor freedom line: This item is a light, 4-foot leash worn around the house. » Finger lead: This lead, shown in Figure 13-1, should be long enough to gently guide but short enough not to distract your dog (1 to 6 inches is a common length).\n\n» Tether-n-train: This type of leash, with a clip on each end (see Figure 13-2) teaches your pup to walk beside you. You can also use this leash outside to tether your puppy to an immovable object (such as a tree or bench) to practice distance Stay directions.

Both warrant gauging whether your goal is to enjoy this time together.

Keeping your puppy focused on you, regardless of their personality or the situation, is the key to happy off-lead experiences.\n\nSome puppies can’t get enough of life! Social, curious, and outgoing, excitable explorer puppies race about, trying to take in every new stimulus. Before practic- ing an off-lead exercise with your excitable explorer, tire them out a bit. Play games (indoors or out) that don’t require strict conformity to detail. Soda Bottle Soccer and Two-Toy Toss (see Chapter 20) are wonderful options. At first, prac- tice your lessons before your puppy’s meals, using either their kibbles or special treats to enhance their focus and cooperation. A clicker (flip to Chapter 5) can often add a spark to lessons as well. If your puppy is too excited to respond, prac- tice on-lead for half the lesson or return to the basics for a few more weeks.\n\nIf your dog is cautious, they’ll be less inclined to romp when you unclip the leash.

If you feel that your puppy’s testing you, you may be on to something, but their resistance is caused less by disrespect than by their interest in learning the rules of this new off-lead game. Practice the lesson only when you can be mindful to detail, and use a freedom line to prevent any mishaps.

The emer- gency Down is a high-octane version of the Down direction that’ll have your puppy hitting the dirt mid-pace. It can be a real lifesaver. I used it to stop one of my puppies who broke their Stay to greet my husband, who was walking home across a busy street.\n\nIn the beginning, your puppy may be a little confused, so be patient and positive throughout their training sessions. Don’t start practicing this exercise until your puppy has mastered the Down direction. (See Chapter 11.) To teach your pup the emergency Down, follow these steps:\n\n1. Stand next to your unsuspecting puppy. 2. Suddenly direct “Down” in an urgent tone as you kneel or bend and point toward the ground, as shown in Figure 13-5.\n\nUse the type of tone you’d use if a loved one were about to walk off a cliff.\n\n3. Tap the ground and repeat Down if they look confused. 4. Act like you’re being bombed, too, by kneeling next to your pup.\n\nIf your puppy needs a food lure initially, go ahead and use one, but phase off within five repetitions to avoid treat dependence. Soon, your puppy will catch on. After they do, begin extending your distance from them as you direct “Down” in your most urgent tone.\n\nThe emergency Down can save your dog’s life.\n\nIt’s true — the emergency Down really does save lives. Once I was leaving my training classes with my husky, Kyia, when a tennis ball slipped loose and started rolling toward the road. Kyia, the sweet thing, wanted to help and ran innocently to collect it. In a panic, I shouted “Down!” and she dropped like a rock. What a good girl!",

Limit your practice to one out-of- the-blue emergency Down sequence a day.\n\nKnowing When to Trust Your Pup and Other FAQs about Off-Lead Training\n\nBefore I address frequently asked questions about off-lead training (OLT) let me warn you: It takes only one mistake to lose your puppy. Many things can happen: your puppy may get confused, or see a friend, or see a squirrel, child, or cat. Many young dogs test their people’s reactions by turning into an instant comedian and bounding away from you just for fun. So practice all initial training in an enclosed area. Keep the situation safe until they’re both mature and reliable. It is never wise to walk a dog near a roadway off leash: don’t do it, no matter how confident you are in your puppy’s reliability.\n\nYou may be wondering many things about OLT at this point. Here’s a list of ques- tions that I’m asked most often:\n\n» When will I know I can trust my dog off-lead? You should feel it. This road is never smooth in the beginning; some days you get a quick and happy response; other days feel more like your first lessons together. Stay cool, though — frustration is a sign of weakness, and you can quickly lose your dog’s respect. You’ll gradually notice your dog’s hesitation diminish. They’ll respond happily and without consideration, and you’ll get a fluid feeling that they enjoy being near you and listening to you. Until this point, keep your puppy in an enclosed area or dragging a freedom line as you practice so that if they start to act cocky, you can retreat immediately. And don’t hesitate to go back to the freedom line or on-lead exercises for a quick review.",

If you hit your dog, you erode your relationship and diminish their off-lead trust. If you’re really angry, walk away calmly. Remember, a graceful retreat is not a failure.\n\n» My puppy breaks every time I leave them in a Stay on their retractable leash. What can I do? Make sure they’re okay with the pull of the leash-pivot in front of them, and then walk forward and — because they may respond to the tug of the leash — remind them to stay. Then increase your distance slowly. For example, if your puppy gets up every time you walk out 15 feet, practice at 10 feet for a week, and then at 11 feet and 12 feet, and so on. » Sometimes my dog crouches and barks at me. How can I make them stop? Don’t look at them. They’re trying to turn all your hard work into a game. Ignore them until their antics subside. Work on-lead at short distances if they’re uncooperative.\n\n» Don’t the lines get caught around trees and doors? Yes, they do. Clip all\n\nlines to the buckle collar and never leave your puppy unsupervised.\n\n» When I place my puppy on the short lead, I can’t get near them. Should I give it up? You need to work on your freedom line for another week or so. When you try the short lead again, put it on with the freedom line and correct them by stepping on it when they dart away.\n\nIf you meet up with an off-lead dog, stay calm. Tensions can get misconstrued, prompt- ing two otherwise peaceful dogs to tussle. Here’s what to expect:",

    "page_content": "Normal greeting: When meeting for the first time, it’s normal for dogs to posture considerably, which may include raised hackles or a raised tail or jumping, pawing, growling, staring, or mouthing. When two dogs meet in an open space, they’ll gen- erally race at an angle to one another and circle, assessing who should organize the interaction. After they’ve established their roles, the dogs will get along unless human interference stresses the situation.\n\nAbnormal greeting: Dogs don’t charge directly at one another unless they’re pre- paring to fight. A face-to-face, chest-to-chest, direct-eye-contact approach is friendly only if you’re a person — dogs view it as an attack. Dogs generally attack one another only if they’re defending their young or protecting their territory. When this type of confrontation occurs, the only hope may be for the other dog to lie still in complete submission or turn and run away, which may or may not happen. If you have any control over the outcome, leave immediately.\n\nA well-behaved dog is a welcome social guest, a plus at parades and picnics, and an added fan at after-school sporting events. The pleasures of having a well-mannered puppy who matures into a wonderful, responsive dog are undeni- able! So, why does the world have so many ill-mannered dogs — dogs who jump and bark at the door, have accidents, and chew their families’ belongings? The answer is straightforward and simple: because no one took the time to teach them how to behave — inside their home or out. Don’t worry: I won’t let that happen to you!",

Make sure your puppy is familiar and comfortable with the setting before you attempt to introduce them to anyone. Don’t greet people your first day out.\n\n2. Before each introduction, insist that your puppy stand still at your side. Gently hold still or bring them back to your side and instruct “Wait.”\n\n3. Tell admirers “We’re in training.” This statement will help them respect your efforts and contain their excitement (hopefully).\n\n4. Stay more focused on your puppy than on the admirer. Insist that your puppy use good manners before you let them approach a new dog or person. 5. Put faith in your knowledge.

However, you need to teach them impulse control or else they may dart headlong into traffic or rush an unfriendly candidate.\n\nBefore you rush up to every dog you see, stop and ask yourself whether the dog is friendly and the people are open to greeting.

If you let frustration creep in, however, your tension will stress your puppy out: Corrections teach your puppy to avoid you when they need to potty, both inside and out.\n\nThe first step in house-training your puppy is to choose the elimination area. Your goal is to teach them to leave their living spaces to go to the bathroom, so decide whether you want that place to be indoors or outdoors. Papers should be neatly arranged in the far corner of a room or pen, away from food and water dishes and gradually shimmied to an out-of-the-way bathroom or mudroom where your adult dog will go for privacy. Outdoors, choose the surface first: Do you want your puppy going on mulch, grass, or pavement, for example? Once that’s decided, choose or create a place by putting down, say, mulch — initially just 10 to 20 feet from the door to help your puppy stay focused on the goal of your outings. Take your puppy to the toilet area on a 6-foot leash and wait until they potty to pet, play, or walk them.\n\nBecause eliminating puts puppies in a vulnerable position, privacy is best. Choose a spot that is discrete, whether indoors or outdoors. Like people, dogs don’t like to potty out in the open, nor should they get in the habit of wandering about to find their ideal elimination spot.\n\nAlthough I find training a dog to go outside makes the most long-term sense, city people often have to start out with paper training until their puppy has received their vaccines. You may also want to choose paper training over taking your dog outside if you have a small dog or an indoor lifestyle. Whatever you choose, many of the same rules apply:",

When you arrive at the potty spot, either place your puppy in a pen or keep them on a leash. Hold off on letting your puppy play or wander until they have done their business.

Whin- ing, nipping, and frenzied activity are all signs that they may need a potty break.\n\nJust how many potty breaks does your puppy need per day? Well, that depends. Young puppies (younger than 12 weeks) may need to go outside every hour or two. Older puppies can hold out quite a bit longer.\n\nUse the general guidelines in Table 14-1 for your puppy.",

If you’re out during the day, follow the schedule shown in Table 14-3. As you go through this schedule, you may remember what I mention in Chapter 6: Dogs are crepuscular — most awake at dawn and dusk and restful during the rest of the day. Your puppy may need to go outside every 30 minutes to an hour in the early morning (depending on their eating, drinking, and playing routines) and then only once or twice dur- ing the stretch between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m. All puppies are different — keep a log to help you recognize patterns.\n\nNote: In Tables 14-2 and 14-3, the italicized events may not be necessary as your puppy matures.\n\nA puppy younger than 12 weeks has little to no bladder control, so you’ll be taking them out quite frequently during the daytime. Occasional accidents are not uncommon during this time, so don’t be discouraged. (See the section “Quick Tips for Handling and Avoiding Accidents,” later in this chapter.) As your puppy matures, they’ll have the bladder control to hold it as well as the awareness to let you know when they need to go potty.\n\nDogs of all ages need interaction between the times listed in the tables, so remem- ber that playtimes are extremely important throughout the day. If you work outside the home, try to come home for lunch or hire a dog walker to split up your dog’s day.\n\nMost puppies need to eliminate after isolation; if you find your puppy uninterested in a meal, take them outside for a quick bathroom run before each feeding.",

If you have to leave for more than four hours, either drop your puppy off at a daycare center, hire a dog walker to stop in at midday, or create a space that allows for a good stretch as well as a place to potty. Though your puppy might be confused at first by your expectation that they potty inside on paper and outside when you’re with them, they will adjust to the routine as long as you’re consistent.\n\nIf you find that your puppy can’t hold their urine — they’re even going in their crate or when stationed — they may have developed a urinary tract infection. If you think this is the case, take a sample of your puppy’s urine to your veteri- narian for testing. To collect a sample from your pup, take a plastic container outside and catch a spray of morning urine by holding it under your puppy as they go. Either race over and drop it off at your veterinarian’s office within an hour or refrigerate it for preservation.\n\nConsistency is the number-one concept of a good house-training routine.

    "page_content": "A young puppy’s needs are confusing. A baby will cry when needs are not met. Puppies, on the other hand, do other things to signal their need confusion, such as fidgeting, nipping, racing away, or whining. I’ve found that nipping is the most common reaction — think of it as a healthy way to reach out for your help. Even though you teach them a better signal down the road, for now be mindful that a young puppy’s nips may highlight their need to potty. Rather than disciplinie a baby puppy, direct them “Outside!” or to their “Papers!”\n\nTo help your puppy learn to give you a more appropriate signal, consider these suggestions:\n\n» Ring a bell or chime. Secure a bell or chime at your puppy’s nose level,\n\nraising it as they grow. (See Figure 14-2.) Tap the bell just before you go on a bathroom run. If your puppy has access to the door, hang it there so that the sound always indicates an open door. Otherwise, start by hanging it next to the gate, stairway, or banister that encloses their free-play area. Ring the bell for them or with them for a week. If they don’t catch on, discreetly smear butter or cheese on the bell first thing in the morning. When your puppy touches the bell, open the door — voilà.\n\n» Bark near their area. If your puppy is a barker, teach them to bark on cue. As you approach the exit area for a potty outing (door, gate, whatever), encour- age them to Speak (see Chapter 16). When they do, praise them lavishly, and on you go outside. Good puppy!",

Good dog!” Show them the bell and then let them out. Repeat the process in rooms farther and farther from the door or their papers, running enthusiastically to the door with them and leading them to their spot on a leash.\n\nTeaching your puppy to ring a bell when they need to go out is easier than you think.\n\nGradually phase out the bathroom escort by letting the leash drop on your way to the potty area. As they learn the drill, start stopping three-quarters of the way there, and then halfway, and then let them go it alone.\n\nShelter or pet store pups often have a handicap when it comes to crate training. After all, they had no choice in that early impressionable time away from Mom. Though a mother dog in an ideal setting would teach their pups to move far away from their sleeping areas to go potty, shelter and pet store puppies often potty, sleep, and eat within the same enclosure.",

    "page_content": "If your puppy is having a problem with soiling in their sleeping area, the crate may not be the best option for house-training, because it symbolizes a potty area. At night, a young puppy can sleep at your bedside in a large, open-topped box or secured on a leash to your bedside (after they’re leash trained and comfortable with daytime stations). If they still can’t seem to keep their areas separate, you may need to gate a bathroom and leave papers down. During the day, keep your puppy with you or confine them in a small room, taking them outside or to the papers as often as your schedule will allow (ideally, within a half-hour to 2-hour period). Take them to the same area, over and over, following the routine described throughout this chapter. Having another dog eliminate in this area is helpful because the scent can give your puppy the right idea.\n\nAccidents do happen, and some puppies will have more than others, so knowing how to handle the situation is the key to limiting their frequency. Here are my quick tips:\n\n» Limit their freedom to a small confinement area. If your puppy is eliminating in little-used corners of your house, they may have too much freedom. Puppies are den animals. Most young or untrained adolescents won’t soil the area right around them, but if they can race upstairs or into an adjacent room outside their “den,” they’re more than happy to relieve themselves there.\n\nKeep your puppy confined in a crate or on a training tether (available online), or use a generic leash to serve the same purpose. A training tether leash can be quickly modified to secure to your waist or to an immovable object in the room you share. Designate an area in each location with a mat and chews so that your puppy can easily occupy themselves if you’re busy.",

    "page_content": "Before letting your puppy run willy-nilly through all the rooms in your home, review Chapter 11 for tips on a more gradually integrated approach, one that I call walkabout.\n\n» Clean up accidents privately. If your puppy eliminates in an unacceptable place, don’t let them see you clean up their mess. Doing so may signal fun with paper towels or a nurturing acceptance — after all, their mom did lick up their messes — that will encourage a repeat performance. Calmly place your puppy in another room or with a family member as you clean it up.\n\n» Neutralize the odor. Your puppy has a very sensitive sniffer. They automati- cally return to areas where their smell is concentrated. Use a pet store formula or a 50-50 mixture of water and vinegar to remove the scent. » Know when corrections count. If you catch your puppy in the process of eliminating in the house, startle them just a little. (Shouting and running at your puppy is way too scary.) Clap your hands as you say, “Ep, ep, ep!” After you’ve interrupted your pup, relax your posture and calmly direct them to the elimination area as if nothing happened. When they’re done, praise your pup for finishing.\n\n» Know when disciplinary actions don’t count. As much as you want to think your pup is human, they aren’t. Your frustration and anger toward your puppy make you look foolish. I’ve heard this claim: “My puppy knows what they did was wrong — you should see the look of guilt on their face.” But the truth is, your puppy doesn’t understand the world in the same way you do.

Sure, you can frighten a puppy into looking guilty, but scaring them won’t teach them anything — except to be leery of you.\n\nIf you catch your pup soiling someplace other than in their designated area, you can interrupt the process, but lay off all other corrections.\n\n» Maintain a stable diet. Avoid changing dog food brands, unless your\n\nveterinarian directs you to do so. Your puppy doesn’t digest food the way you do: Their intestine is small and unable to process and absorb a varied diet. If you must change food, do it slowly, shifting 25% every three days until you have 100% of the new food.\n\n» If your puppy is pooping in the house, lay off constant food treats. If you sporadically give food in any form throughout the day, their elimination habits may be random.\n\n» Watch the water intake. Puppies, especially young ones, drink water\n\nexcessively if they’re bored or nervous. If your pup is having house-training problems, monitor their water intake. Provide water or ice cubes (which absorb faster into their system than water) during mealtimes, just before an outing, and when they pant or go to their bowl.\n\nRegardless of where you live, pick up after your puppy.

The choice of how your puppy behaves is really up to you.\n\nYour puppy’s misbehavior exists only in your mind. From their perspective, what- ever they’re doing — sock stealing, counter cruising, nipping, digging, barking, or engaging in impulsive greeting rituals — has value and is often just plain fun.

Ideally, you’ll condition your puppy to stimulations they’ll experience throughout their life. Sometimes your puppy will condition involuntary (known as classical conditioning), as in their response to the sound of a treat or food bag, and at other times you can condition voluntary responses, like teaching your puppy to sit when they see you holding a toy or food reward. Though you can use conditioning to train your dog chosen habits like sitting instead of jumping, your puppy can also condition bad habits just as quickly.\n\n» Counter-condition: Dogs can be taught new behaviors and routines to\n\ncounter another habit, like lying down or returning to your side when they see another dog on a leash, or sitting or fetching a toy when they hear a doorbell.\n\n» Desensitize: Desensitization involves gradually exposing your puppy to\n\nstimulations, like a noise or dog, that otherwise bring about a strong startle response until they’ve conditioned to its presence without reaction. » Extinguish: This references a way to bring an end to behavior by simply ignoring it. When a puppy barks for attention you can ignore it until the behavior is extinguished.\n\n» Habituate: This term refers to the gradual exposure to a former overstimulat- ing situation until your puppy can redirect or cope with the situation more calmly.

You can also use mimicry to teach your puppy the meaning of new words like “Upstairs” or “Outside.”\n\nneeds to hire a trainer is that trainers are proactive planners who understand behavior problems without needing to see them in action. Proactive training involves teaching your puppy what to do rather than waiting until your puppy is misbehaving to call attention to the wrong behavior.\n\n» Punishment: Anything that discourages a behavior is known as a punish- ment. Positive punishment adds something that your puppy will want to avoid, like a shock or a shove (although most positive punishments scare your puppy and result in other undesirable behavior, like chewing, self-mutilation,\n\nor avoidance). Negative punishment removes something when an action happens, like lifting a treat out of reach when your puppy jumps.\n\n» Redirect: Redirection involves changing your puppy’s focus from one activity to another activity.

Many people (including many ineffective trainers) wait until bad behavior occurs to direct or interfere with a puppy’s behavior. Instead of resulting in understanding, reactive responses create a negative behavior loop that strains the relationship between puppy and parent and leads to other annoying rituals like pacing, barking, and self-mutilation.\n\nAvoid anyone who tells you to use battery-operated collars that deliver shocks as a training strategy for your dog — and remember that these collars are illegal in many European countries.\n\n» Reinforce: Anything that encourages a behavior to occur is considered to be reinforcing the behavior. Certain positive reinforcements provide something rewarding to your puppy, like a reward for sitting for treats and toys — ensuring that they’ll repeat the response. On the other hand, negative reinforcements remove a positive aspect, such as covering your face each time your puppy jumps or paws for attention. (Puppies crave face-to-face contact and will adjust their behavior if it is denied them.)\n\n» Socialize: This process involves getting your puppy used to the different\n\nsights, sounds, and stimulations they’ll be exposed to throughout their life. A puppy who isn’t well socialized will have strong, often paralyzing reactions to unfamiliar things.\n\n» Trigger: Anything that stimulates a strong reaction in your puppy is commonly called a trigger.

Calmly redirect them to their toys and play with them if you have a few minutes.\n\nI can hear you already: “Doesn’t treating encourage the behavior?” Even though this technique doesn’t discourage your puppy’s mischief, it does encourage them to share their treasures, which can save you a lot in replacement fees. A delivery system is better than a destruction crew.\n\nIf your puppy has learned to run away from you with objects, place them on a 4-foot freedom line in the house, and then step on the line as you shake the cup and follow the new routine of tossing treats on the floor and encouraging them to Grab-n-Show. After they understand that your approach isn’t threatening, the next time your puppy grabs something you don’t want them to have, find a treat cup, shake it, and call them over. Say “Give” as you offer a treat. Praise them when they release the object and help them find a chew toy. You can say “Where’s your toy?” to encourage them.\n\nHow you shape your puppy’s understanding of what to chew and what not to depends on their age. Puppies younger than 16 weeks are like babies: self-absorbed and floating from one need state to another. They sleep, they eat, and they poop. Sure, they pick things up, but they’re not aware of any value or consequence. An older puppy, however, begins to seek things out to get your attention or to relieve physical growing pains. How you deal with your puppy depends on their age.",

Sure, when you yell or grab them, they may look guilty, but I’ve got news for you: You’re only terrifying them. Think about it: The very person they look to for reas- surance is chasing them down, wild-gorilla style. Pretty scary, no?\n\nYour puppy’s mouth is equivalent to your hands: If your puppy is restless, or ner- vous, they chew. Young puppies live moment to moment just doing whatever comes naturally. They can’t remember what they did two seconds ago, so all interruptions are translated as confrontational — by the very person they love. And if that weren’t bad enough, guess what an overcorrected, nervous, fearful puppy grows up doing to relieve their tension? Right — they chew!\n\nFortunately, I can introduce you to a better way. The following system works for puppies at any age, but it’s especially important to teach a young puppy good chewing habits:\n\n» Create a playroom: Place a mat down to rest on and a collection of their toys and chew items. Keep it clean, with no other temptations around. Spend time together teaching them to identify toys and chews by name.\n\n» Take a walkabout: These are planned “walks” round and about your home; use them to condition your puppy where to go to find their place, toys and chews in each room you share. Guide your puppy on a leash, and show them their places in various rooms in the house. (You can learn more\n\n» EP, ep: If your puppy shows interest in grasping an inappropriate object, tug their leash toward you and say “EP, ep,” and then quickly redirect your puppy to your side with a quick Find It game or to their place and toys.",

That said, if you come upon destruction after the fact, you have to let it go. After-the-fact correc- tions are ineffective and damaging to your relationship because your puppy will grow anxious of your sudden (and to them, anyway, unexplainable) outburst. On the flip side, correcting the thought process and then shaming the object of interest helps teach your puppy what to avoid. And, when done correctly, this method puts the negative focus outside your relationship, allowing you to maintain your loving connection.\n\nReview the Leave It instruction, as taught in Chapter 11. Then set up a situation with something your puppy’s obsessed with — tissues, shoes, a Barbie doll, or whatever else strikes their fancy — and follow these steps:\n\nWhile your puppy’s resting in another room, set the object in the middle of the floor.\n\nThough a casual glance or sniff is okay, racing or grabbing the item is not. If they’re intent on a snatch (ears and eyes focused, leaning away from you and toward the item), guide them back (using a high value treat if you need too) and say “Leave it.”\n\n4. Bad Sock!

Your neighbors may think you need to be committed, but your puppy will love you for it.\n\nIf your puppy walks by without lunging, keep them focused. Your reminder to Leave it combined with a treat or toy should convince them to ignore the chastened object like the plague (See Figure 15-2.) If they don’t ignore it, consider their age; they may be too impulsive to absorb this lesson (wait a month and Your puppy repeat this sequence after they turn six months), or you may be looking at them, or perhaps your timing is off. Say “Leave it” as your puppy approaches the item, and then scold the item, not your puppy.\n\nAvoid practicing off-lead. If you can’t stabilize your puppy, they’re more likely to dance about, snatching at the object and then darting away from you, turning this lesson into a game of bait and chase.\n\nUse the Leave it to catch your puppy in the thought process. If your puppy already has an object in their mouth, you’re too late. Stay very calm at this point and focus on teaching your puppy to share their finds instead of coveting them as described above.\n\n“What sock?” If you scold an object, your puppy then avoids it.\n\nPuppies, being puppies, are bound to chase and grab at things.

You may want to check out that chapter before trying out this section’s strategies in your day-to-day interactions with your pup.\n\nIf your puppy is a clothing grabber or a scarf puller or a hair band snatcher, you’ll need to make it crystal-clear that worn objects are off limits. Purchase or make a dog play pole that you can bounce about like a fishing rod as you encourage your puppy to Go Get Your Toy and play Tug-Tug-Give (described in Chapter 20) with their toy. Then fill a small spray bottle with a distasteful spray deterrent and carry it with you when you suspect an assault. Don’t look at your puppy or turn and face them when they jump after your clothes, as they’ll interpret your actions as rough play or confrontational. Without looking at your puppy or responding impulsively, spray your clothing discreetly while your puppy is instigating this interaction and continue walking.\n\nIf the clothes-grabbing problem persists, get help now. It can mature into adult aggression — no joke.\n\nKids and critters running around the yard, apartment, or house are a big tempta- tion to your puppy. If you were a puppy, you’d be stimulated to chase them, too. Because you can’t teach kids and critters to freeze on cue, you need to help your puppy control their impulses.

Remind the children of the differences between dogs and other kids — namely, that dogs don’t like being hugged, because it makes them feel trapped and threatened and they only stare directly at each other when inviting rough play or a fight. Because kids have poor memories, grown-ups have to be around to remind them.\n\nIf your puppy could get their paws on some magic device that conveyed them through the world at eye level to humans, they’d never jump again.

When you correct them — nudge them off the couch or attempt to repel their 2-legged embrace, they translate your physical interaction as playful, exciting, and interactive.

(See Figure 15-3.) The pros would say that we’re solving the problem by extinguishing it. Consider this: If I kept bugging you to play Monopoly and you didn’t look up once, I’d go elsewhere for fun. After your puppy stops jumping, encourage them by saying “Sit” or “Go get your toy!” and then give them attention for that.\n\n» Block: This solution often takes puppies by surprise. Do it gently and without any engagement with your eyes or torso. As your puppy jumps, calmly move your leg or torso into the space their body occupies so that they’re bumped slightly off balance. Even if they try to jump a couple of times, keep moving your leg into their space. When they pause to consider the incident, instruct “Sit\" and praise them.\n\n» Reverse yo-yo: If your puppy’s a real jumper, keep a lead (at least 4’ long)\n\nattached to their collar. When they jump, either step on the leash so that it’s short enough to get them only a few inches off the ground but no higher, or gently pull your puppy sideways. Continue to ignore them as if they weren’t there, giving no eye contact, body language, or verbal corrections until they’ve settled enough to sit calmly.\n\n» Spray away: Also effective when it comes to discouraging eager jumpers is to spray a bitter-tasting deterrent (lemon juice-water, vinegar-water at a 50% mix, or a marketed taste deterrent) between your bodies. Avoid spraying your puppy in the face; spray your clothing instead to create a vapor boundary between you. After your puppy pulls away, refocus their energy to a toy or game.",

Relax your hand in your puppy’s mouth and say “Gentle” as long as they’re doing just that.\n\nTeach kisses: Whenever your puppy licks you, say “Kisses” and praise them warmly. Encourage licking by slathering your hands with a frozen stick of butter. Yum! With the butter treat, they’ll gladly lick your hand instead of mouthing it.\n\nTeach YOUCH: When your puppy bites down too hard (which will happen), make a big sudden to-do like you’re hurt, which may not be so hard to pretend, after all. Shout “YOUCH” dramatically, and watch your puppy’s reaction. Some take it to heart, recognizing your pain threshold, and return to gentle mouthing. Other puppies find your theatrics hysterically funny and get even more excited. If your puppy is the latter, don’t try this again, because it’ll only make matters worse.\n\n» Redirect: Puppies generally mouth because they want to be with you. If you substitute a toy for flesh, stay with your puppy as you encourage them to engage in a chew. You can also try these strategies:\n\nCheck your puppy’s needs chart: Needy puppies (hungry or thirsty; tired or wound up; potty-ready) get mouthy.\n\nPlay games.

Mouthing is loving, nipping is bossy — and it smarts. A nip- ping puppy isn’t a bad puppy. They’re just pushy — and because you’re the one who let them get away with being pushy in the first place (although I’m sure it wasn’t your intention), you’re the only one who can get them to stop.\n\nYour puppy might nip you from behind to demand your attention. A puppy might nip in play or when chewing a bone or resting and they don’t want to be bothered.\n\nPhysical corrections get interpreted as confrontational play, so they can cause a puppy to escalate their mouthing to nipping as a defensive reaction.\n\nIf you have children, please flip to Chapter 8 for more tips on raising them together.\n\nDiscouraging nipping follows the same pattern of the other behavior modification strategies I’ve mentioned:\n\nConsider whether your puppy might be overtired (one of the leading causes of early-onset aggression) or under-exercised. Both situations can cause very similar reactions.\n\nWrite down all the situations that trigger your puppy’s nipping — for example, when they’re resting or chewing a bone or you’re talking on the phone.",

(For instructions on these game alternatives, see Chapter 20.)\n\nSit-for-everything training will give your puppy a whole new perspective. Instead of being pushy, they will wait on your every direction: To your puppy, life is a game. You want to be the one to teach them what comes next. Have your puppy sit for everything, and use treats, toys, or even their meals (feeding them kibble by kibble or spooning out the food, if you have the time) as you walk around asking them to Sit by the stairs, in the hallway, and by the door. Getting bored with just sitting? Work on Down and Stand and Come — see Chapters 10–14 for instructions.\n\nLeave a leash on your puppy so that you have something to direct them with — and so that you can avoid physical confrontation. Use a long line outdoors and a drag lead indoors (when your puppy is enjoying free rein of the house) to enable easy guiding.",

Flip back to Chapter 8 for a full explanation of this game, but in short any countertop can be used as an island! Have the kids ignore your puppy completely, until they are calmly standing or sitting on all four paws. If the puppy continues to jump, tell the kids to cover their faces with their eyes. Once your puppy is settled, the kids can toss toys or treats at a safe distance!\n\nSpray away. If your puppy persists, try spritzing yourself with bitter apple spray or putting a leash on your puppy so that you can guide them off your body part instead of leaping out of their way.\n\nPurchase several small spray misters to place around your home for handy access. Discreetly hold them in your hand as you spray whatever object your puppy is nipping — clothing, furniture, or body part.\n\nNever stare at your pup while you spritz or spray them. Doing so turns an unpleasant result into a confrontational interaction.\n\nIf your interactions and discouragement don’t calm your puppy’s reactivity, find a professional to help you rehabilitate them.

They notice things and respond to unusual sights and sounds. Your pup is now fully aware of comings and goings — yours and everyone else’s. They grow bored with the same old stuff and worrisome when alone. Without your understanding and direction, or if unfairly disciplined for what are, to your puppy, completely normal reactions to life’s uncertainties, their reactive behavior will get worse and not better.\n\nIn this chapter, you’ll learn how to respond and redirect the behaviors that con- cern or aggravate you — like digging, barking, aggression, leash reactivity, and other anxious behavior (especially when left alone). Keep in mind, though, that changing your puppy’s behavior is less about them and more about how you han- dle their reactions to everyday situations. Hyperassertive or soothing approaches generally backfire because they’re more interactive than instructional.\n\nIf you read along and analyze just what might be causing your puppy’s reaction, you can tweak your response. Remember: Everything depends on what you do at the moment. If you react to a barking, lurching, digging, mounting, or grazing puppy with the wrong kind of intervention, you’re guaranteed a repeat perfor- mance. If instead you counter-condition, desensitize, or redirect them (more on those terms in a bit), you can guide your puppy to a behavior that’s more chill or socially acceptable, like chewing on a bone, sitting still and watching you, or fetching. Are you wondering, “What can I do to redirect my puppy to a new skill or to alleviate my puppy’s stress completely?” Read on to figure out the answer.",

This section identifies the various types of aggression and gives some advice on how to hold it in check.\n\nThe following descriptions and suggestions don’t take the place of professional attention if your puppy is showing aggression. Aggression becomes more serious as puppies mature and lose their puppyhood inhibitions.\n\nNever approach an aggressive dog, and do not face them straight on — those movements are perceived as challenging. If you get into an encounter with an aggressive dog, don’t run away in a frantic panic: Many dogs view this behavior as prey-like and may chase and bite you. When possible, drop your head and close your eyes — and don’t move. After a dog sniffs you over and accepts your non- threatening posture, they’ll likely retreat. If you need to move away, back away slowly and do not make eye contact with the dog.\n\nDo you have an interactive pup under your roof who steals clothing for fun, barks for attention, leans against you in new environments or around strangers, or\n\nsuccessfully solicits attention whenever the mood strikes? Giving constant attention and dedication to their motion conveys the notion that you’re the one being trained!

Next, approach your puppy and kneel or crouch so that you are able to toss the treat into their bowl while they are eating or between their paws. If your puppy tenses up or growl as you approach them during a meal, stop and seek professional advice immediately. Your puppy is too close to what’s known as a biting threshold and may bite anyone who stands too close them. Don’t let your puppy become another dog-bite statistic.\n\n4.

Even outside their territory, do they react aggressively when anyone approaches? If so, they may think it’s their job to defend themselves against the unknown. You must teach them to look to you when their life feels overwhelming.\n\nMany dogs develop a protective relationship when their owners are too relaxed during a walk, as in talking on their cellphone and paying little attention to where they’re going and who they’re with — namely, their puppy. If you want a well-mannered puppy, take an active role in the walk to ensure that they walk respectfully at your side. Otherwise, your dog will roam in front or drag you along and then act aggressively when they encounter unknown situations, people, or other animals.\n\nTo correct protective aggression, you must identify what your puppy’s triggers are (seeing or hearing people at the front door, through the window, or on the street, for example,) and then train and work with your puppy to keep them below their breaking point.

Is your puppy giving you no respect?\n\nPredatory aggression is an instinctive behavior from pre-domestication, when dogs still had to hunt for survival. Most dogs still possess a chasing instinct. Even though breeders have suppressed the drive to kill in most breeds, some dogs instinctively chase and, in some instances, catch what they’re after.\n\nIf you have a chaser on your hands, rehabilitating them is quite a project. Instincts hold powerful sway over behavior. Focused play gives a chaser an outlet, but you\n\nneed to redirect their impulses with other animals or children to discourage inter- active chasing rituals. For focused predatory games, see Chapter 20; to correct your puppy’s impulses with kids, see the discussion of chasing behavior in Chapter 15.\n\nEvery litter has its shy puppies. These mama’s boys or girls depend on their mom’s wisdom for safety. After these pups move into human homes, they con- tinue to be needy. Their timidity, which surfaces in new situations, may turn into overwhelming fear if you don’t give them proper direction and support. A puppy in this situation may react aggressively during adolescence.\n\nAlthough shyness is a temperamental trait, a puppy’s reactivity can be toned down through routine socialization and exposure to specific stimulations.

Idiopathic aggression falls into two general categories:\n\n» Erratic viciousness: At unpredictable intervals, a puppy in this category\n\ngrowls fiercely from their belly. This behavior may happen when the puppy’s owner passes the food bowl, approaches when they’re chewing a toy, or even walks past them. At other times, the dog is perfectly sweet.\n\n» Fear-biting: A puppy in this category shows dramatic fear or a startled bite response to nonthreatening situations such as turning a page of the news- paper or the sudden movement of an arm.

Unfortunately, their fate was sealed by the people who ran the puppy mill they came from or who bred them irresponsibly, and it’s often the result of extreme early stress or inbreeding. In my career, I’ve seen only a handful of idiopathic puppies, and all were purchased from unknown or suspi- cious breeders. If you suspect that your puppy is displaying erratic viciousness or fear-biting, speak to your breeder and veterinarian immediately and call a spe- cialist to analyze the situation.\n\nTo determine how serious the aggressive behavior is, you need to consider the follow- ing factors:",

These breeds have a greater propensity toward reactive responses like aggression when they feel threatened, because they’re not genetically programmed to look to people for interpretation. Breeds from the Herding and Sporting groups are genetically programmed to look to people for direction, so seeing a 17-week-old Golden Retriever, known for its passive nature, growling over their dish is more alarming than seeing a protective dog growl over their possessions. Neither dog should growl, but a growling Golden indicates that you may have a deeper problem than just a breed-inherent trait. Research the breed. Recognize your pup’s personality. Understanding their natural inclinations and working through them at the earliest age possible can help you prevent problems.\n\nAge: A very young puppy should not show serious signs of protecting food and toys. Though an occasional play growl is normal, hard stares and belly growls are causes for concern; consult with a professional to determine how you ought to han- dle your situation. As your puppy matures, their hormones will release, and they may begin to use more assertive reactions (like jumping up, growling, or nipping) to communicate. Though normal, this is still cause for concern. A puppy who chal- lenges people is showing a sharp lack of social inhibition that can lead to a lifetime pattern of confrontation. Call a professional for your puppy if the pattern of aggres- sion escalates or continues.",

    "page_content": "Temperament: Aggression is an emotional reaction when an animal is frustrated or fearful. All puppies determine early whether you’re giving direction or taking it. If you’re not considered authoritative, your puppy will take charge of their own life. As they grow, they become more mindful of sounds and stimulation and may often use defensive displays like barking or aggression to keep their space (your house- hold) under tight surveillance. Of course, passive puppies can show a similar type of aggression. When a passive puppy is neglected or untrained, they may assume self- protective behavior in reaction to changes.\n\nEarly play patterns: If you bring up your puppy on games of rough wrestling and tug-of-war, they may become aggressive during adolescence. These challenge games can set the stage for larger confrontations, especially if the puppy’s training is ignored.\n\nCorrective techniques: If a young puppy is subjected to heavy-handed corrections early in their life, they learn self-control through fear, not through understanding. For example, if you slap your puppy for grabbing a sock, they may grab the sock less often when they’re with you, but they’ll be more protective of the sock after it’s obtained (known as possession aggression).\n\nIf you have a puppy who shows aggression when resting, keep them off your bed or couch. You may not think it’s a big deal, but an aggressive dog thinks that these high sleeping grounds are their right to be defended, not a privilege. If you can’t keep them off your bed, crate or station them nearby. (See Chapter 11 for stationing tips.) If they growl as you attempt to relocate them, call a pro.",

Start these tips early on to prevent a lifelong barking habit, and remember that puppies sound off for a lot of reasons — primarily because they’re excited or stimulated but also because they’re just plain bored.\n\nThe first step in teaching your puppy not to bark is to recognize the impossibility of that statement. Puppies bark like kids talk, and though some are quieter than others, that’s all relative. Here’s a more realistic goal:\n\n1. Condition your puppy to everyday sounds. 2. Socialize your puppy to the people and places that they’ll meet and see throughout their lifetime.\n\n3. Teach more appropriate self-soothing activities to help your puppy cope with slow days or times when they’ll be alone. 4. Teach your puppy to quiet down on cue.\n\nA chronic barker is a real headache. How you handle your puppy, especially as they’re initially testing their vocalizations, will dictate how much barking you’ll hear over the next decade-plus.

Barking is their way of alerting you to something that’s approaching. This trait was a key part of the dog- human bond that’s not as necessary as it used to be. One way to help your puppy condition to everyday noises so that they’ll be less likely to alert to everything they see or hear is to condition and desensitize them using food and fun. For example, to prevent your puppy from barking every time someone comes to the door or walks by, have treats and toys at the ready and use them to distract your puppy. Soon your puppy will recognize the noise as part of their daily routine, whereas yelling at them for barking will reinforce that something scary was going down.\n\nMake recordings of everyday sounds like the doorbell, the garage door opening, the elevator, or footsteps in the hallway — whatever might or does alert your puppy. Play these recordings at low volume to desensitize your puppy to the sound while playing or feeding your puppy so that they’re accustomed to the noise and associate each with good things!\n\nThe cardinal sin when rehabilitating a barker is yelling. When you yell, your puppy thinks you’re barking too, which leads to — you guessed it — more barking. To solve your problem, stay cool and follow the advice in this section.",

Nothing could be more critical in helping your puppy feel safe in your home (which in turn leads to less alert-barking) than socializing them to everyday rou- tines and people. Use treats and happy talk when introducing your puppy to your daily cast of characters, from your neighbors and friends to delivery people of every persuasion (postal, pizza, and beyond!). Here is a hit list of other essential socialization scenarios:\n\n» Anyone or anything approaching your car: Condition your puppy to see people and other animals approach or pass the car while you’re driving and when you’re parked. Use treats or chews or busy toys, and have people — like gas and fast food attendants and children — toss treats into the car when they approach to speak with you.\n\n» Delivery people, dog walkers, and yard workers: These helpers are staples in our lives and come in all shapes and sizes. Ask them to pay the puppy toll each time they visit, tossing a super prize to your puppy each time they enter — a handful of high-value treats, a busy toy stuffed with a super-savory treat, or a tasty chew set aside for special occasions.\n\n» Plumbers, carpenters, construction workers, and so on: Whether you\n\ninvite working folks in to fix up your home (which I recommend you do if at all possible, just to socialize your puppy) or visit with some in the neighborhood, socialize your puppy to the whirring and the banging and the other (some- times random yet familiar) noises of manual labor.",

Knowing that your puppy won’t be alert-barking every time they hear a ball bounce or see a bike go by should be encouragement enough to get started early!\n\n» Neighborhood dogs and cats: Introduce your puppy to neighborhood dogs and cats as early as you’re able to. Because they’ll spend their entire lives separated in a zoo-like existence, it’s far better that they exchange friendly barks, greetings, and get-togethers for occasional romps than it is for them to establish a defensive relationship.\n\nPuppies bark when they’re bored and have nothing else going on. They bark to get a rise out of you or to communicate with another pet or the barking dog down the\n\nhall or across the street. Your immediate goal, whether it’s preventing barking or redirecting an already formed habit, is to find another way for your puppy to self- soothe. One tried-and-tested method is to provide your puppy with busy toys and feeding tubes — hollowed-out bones or plastic, chewable container toys — that your puppy will have to chew and work on to get their food. I realize that might sound cruel to you, but dogs are programmed to hunt, and after a few days of working fervently to get their food from a chewable feeding tube, the activity will be a more pleasant and exhausting habit than barking their head off — so much so that habitual chewing will take the place of chronic barking!",

When you yell, you’re reinforcing the barking and supporting your puppy’s role as border patrol. Anytime you see or hear your puppy start to perk up, call them back to you using a treat cup or a dragging leash (refer to Chapter 5) if they won’t focus.

They bark when you’re focused on something else: the dishes, computer, or dinner table, for example. Prepare yourself: The first bark is always the most precious, but believe me: The barking-for-attention gag loses its glow fast.

Keep to the schedule laid out in Chapter 6, making sure you’ve given your puppy not only a tiring play romp but a midday nap too. A tired puppy is a yappy puppy.\n\n» Focus on good behavior. Reconnect warmly to your puppy whenever they’re chewing a toy, exploring calmly, or resting on their bed. Give them a sense of how to get your attention positively.\n\n» Ignore the barking if you can, and never yell. Your puppy translates\n\nshouting as — you guessed it — more barking. Earplugs help.\n\n» Interfere without attention. If you must address the barkfest, do so discreetly by entering the zone without eye contact or notice. Generally speaking, being in the same space will calm any fussing, but regardless, wait until your puppy has settled to leash them up for a walkabout, or place them in their crate or a quiet room with a bone to redirect their angst.\n\nPuppies mount for a whole host of reasons, and none of them is wrong or bad. Mounting, which is gender neutral, generally starts around five to seven months of age. Puppies mount because it feels good, new, and different — it’s a fun way for them to self-soothe. And yes, boys will mount things as a general response to their surging sex hormones, but this is only one of many situations that cause this behavior. Female dogs mount, too: In this respect, mounting is used to displace tension or test rank. So, don’t go off the deep end if your puppy — male or female — is scaling your pillows, your leg, or your neighbor’s Chihuahua.",

Here’s how:\n\n1. Pick one area where your puppy can dig to their heart’s content, whether that spot is around your house or in a park (if you live in an apartment or a condo). You can also buy your pup a sandbox to give their digging some satisfaction. 2. Bring toys and treats to hide when you model how to dig by digging yourself in front of your puppy.

Teach them to follow your lead by shaking your treat cup or luring them with a treat or toy. Gradually extend the distance between each reinforcement. 3. Begin to lift the leash and use it to guide your puppy through familiar rooms in your home.\n\n4.

If your puppy is grazing on grass, sticks, and pebbles, you need to be mindful, but don’t go bonkers. Any hyper reactions will only draw more attention to your puppy’s activity, making them more likely to graze again. Instead, teach them the puppy version of Leave It (see Chapter 11), and take toys and treats with you on your outings. If you toss, drag, or play with treats and toys on your walks, your puppy will be less likely to search for random mouthables.\n\n» To a puppy, any attention is good attention. If you focus on your puppy when they’re mouthing, running away from you, or eating an unacceptable item, your body language and actions are saying “prize envy!” Your puppy will likely grab more things or, worse, grab the forbidden items only when you’re not looking.",

When you go out together, direct your puppy to these activities and play together.\n\n» Teach Bring. Your puppy can learn fetching games early on; use multiple toys when they’re young so that you’re always seen as having the better toy.\n\n» Never chase or grab objects from your puppy. Puppies love a chase — they always feel in control, even if it ends up in your favor. Chasing a puppy may lead to gulping the evidence the moment they perceive your interest in taking their prize.\n\n» Keep the house clean. The surest way to prevent your puppy from grabbing non-digestible items is to keep them out of reach. That’s easier said than done, for sure, but way less costly than an operation.\n\nSome puppies love squeak toys; others gut them. If your puppy tears or ingests objects, eliminate those types of toys or bones from their toy box. Find toys that your puppy enjoys playing with and that are durable to stand up to their ideas of fun.\n\nPuppies hate separation. If they had their way, they’d follow you to the ends of the earth. But, alas, they can’t. Puppies suffering from FOBA (fear of being alone) have varying degrees of separation stress. Although few puppies start with full- blown separation anxiety, many unfortunately end up there. To ensure that your puppy learns to cope with isolation, learn the three levels of isolation issues, in growing severity, so that you can analyze your puppy’s reactions and deal with the symptoms before they get out of hand.",

These puppies may begin to cling to you when you’re home, nudge, lean in, or paw for reassur- ance, sometimes just seconds after you’ve stopped petting them. Many prefer accompaniment when going outside or into another room. What you may think is bonding can quickly evolve into a more serious attachment disorder if confidence- building measures are not taken. (See the later section “Helping a puppy with isolation issues.”).\n\nIf your puppy is stressing when left in a crate, especially in the first days of sepa- rating from their litter, consider a Snuggle Puppy toy, as described in Chapter 5, to give them a sense of comfort when you can’t be near them.\n\nOne level above anxiety is distress, defined as a growing sense of anxiety when left alone, including hyper-excitement when you’re preparing to go as well as when you come back. You may notice a change in your reaction to your puppy’s behavior as well — from adoration to feeling guilty or resentful.\n\nPuppies who are distressed often eliminate or chew destructively when left alone. Never, and I say never — repeat, NEVER — discipline a puppy after the fact, espe- cially if you suspect distress. Your corrections will be paired with the separation, making each separation from you all the more stressful. At that pace, your puppy is at risk of going from a puppy who isn’t crazy about departures, but can never- theless cope, to one with full-blown separation anxiety.",

Symptoms include a pronounced reaction to anything that hints of departure — from simple readying routines like dressing, bathroom rou- tines, or even the sound of the car keys — to chewing, clawing, barking, pottying, stress pacing, window escaping, and frenzied greeting rituals when reunited. Although a discussion of true separation anxiety is well beyond the scope of this book, if you suspect that your puppy is far gone, reach out to the woman who has become the separation anxiety guru here in the states, Malena DeMartini. Her books, lectures, and personalized digital lessons are spot-on: Check her out in print and online at https://malenademartini.com.\n\nPuppies with separation anxiety cannot be easily isolated when you can’t be home. These dogs grow increasingly frantic in the crate, pacing, whining, and attempt- ing to escape to the point of doing physical harm to the paws or mouth or entire body.\n\nYour veterinarian may recommend a veterinarian behaviorist to help you analyze your puppy’s condition and prescribe medication to alleviate their separation anxiety.

No matter the amount of affection you offer, it never seems to be enough. What they need in order to feel more secure in their world is more direction, not more attention, but because they’re not getting it, they impulsively check in with you, time and time again.\n\nTheir constant interaction speaks volumes: Their constant vigil to get attention is a sign of their insecurity: “Do you love me? It’s been seven seconds; do you still love me?” Although your puppy adores you, what they need most is the direction to help them organize their behavior in your home. Without guidance, this type of puppy is prone to a virtual panic attack when left alone in the house. » Assertive puppy: Left to their own devices, confident and bossy puppies like to organize the household activity, so they need to learn their manners and be trained to listen to their people. Headstrong, they’re often unimpressed by you — until, that is, you leave the den (your home) and they’re trapped inside. When that happens, frustration anxiety sets in.",

If you need help with training, get it. In the meantime, here are some tips:\n\n» Don’t waste your energy on correcting your puppy after the fact. You’ll only make your problems much worse. Your corrections get linked to your arrival, adding another reason for your puppy to stress while you’re out. » Think of it this way: When you leave your home, you’re trapping your puppy inside. They can’t get out if they want to — and they will want to. Puppies (like people) want to explore sights and sounds. Your puppy cannot snack, hop online, or text a friend either, so the best choice is to teach your\n\npuppy to rest or chew while you’re out. Left to their own devices and given more freedom than they can manage, they will get nasty and frustrated, which leads to barking, chewing (items as well as themselves), and marking.\n\n» Up the play and training routines to build your puppy’s confidence. Play and training go together — use words including Sit, Down, Place, Find It, Come, and Stay before you toss your puppy’s toys and offer food or treats. Work on tethering stays around the house. Take your puppy out for random adventures and play-train your puppy while you spend time together. These word directions and reassurances will help steady their nerves when you’re gone.

Make a list of possibilities, like Get Your Toy, Sit and Stay for ten seconds, or Find It games. Although giving your puppy attention whenever and however they ask for it might seem natural to you, just ask yourself what your puppy will do when you’re not there to satisfy their attention itch the second they have it?\n\n» Create steady come-and-go patterns. Leave your puppy alone a lot, even if it’s just to go to the bathroom or answer the door. Sure, your puppy will fuss — most do — but don’t pay a lot of attention to it. If they follow you to the bathroom or gate, say “Stay” and block their following with your leg. If your puppy whines or barks while you’re gone, that’s their issue; ignore them until they’ve calmed down. That means no eye contact, petting, or nurturing until they’re self-soothing or coping. Gradually and mindfully increase your departure lengths from 30 seconds to a minute to two minutes and then to five minutes to ten minutes. (For more on practicing departures, see the Stay exercises in Chapter 13.)\n\n» Establish a leave-alone routine. Keep in mind that dogs are by their nature calm, restful animals. Crepuscular (versus diurnal or nocturnal) means that they rest 75 percent of the day and are most awake at dawn and dusk. To create sleeping patterns in keeping with their natural rhythm and to reduce the separating stress they feel, follow a few calming routines:\n\nDrown the silence. Puppies don’t like silence: It often makes them antsy and unnerved as they’re left to interpret every noise they hear. Leave on reggae or soft rock, or buy specially composed dog music to mask the sounds of silence.",

Use the sleep schedule outlined in Chapter 7 to establish resting and feeding times, and use your puppy’s crate for both, especially if your puppy is reluctant to settle during those times.\n\nLeave your puppy a favorite chew toy. Rub the toy between your palms so that it smells like you.\n\nIf you routinely go out for long stretches, either come home every three hours or hire someone to take your puppy out. Though it’s okay to leave your puppy for two separate 3-hour blocks of time in a row, any more may result in crate accidents or, worse, your puppy may develop isolation anxiety. If long departures are the norm, consider a pen, an enclosed room, or daycare. (See Chapter 8 for more on daycare.)\n\nDon’t give in to “pet me” solicitations. The petting-on-demand ritual makes being alone even more difficult. Going from lots of attention to no attention at all is too sharp a contrast for a pup.

Begin to engage the puppy at the moment while continuing to avoid eye contact or directly facing your puppy, which may feel more like a confronta- tion than comfort.\n\n» Does the tinkling happen when your puppy is overexcited or frustrated? See if you can calm down. If you’re too hyper, they get scared; if you’re too frustrated or angry, they also get nervous. It’s just the way some puppies are: They know when you’re out of control.\n\n» Disciplinary actions are ineffective and make matters much worse. Forgive your puppy now — they don’t understand why you’re mad.\n\nUse treat cups and favorite objects to engage your puppy when they’re nervous or excited. Ask a guest to shake treats from a cup and to kneel versus bending over to pet your puppy.\n\nWhether you soothe or admonish them, your attention reinforces the moment’s mood, whether that’s excitement or fear.

The wrong diet can increase your puppy’s susceptibility to disease, infection, and, possibly, nervous/aggressive disorders.\n\nYou have a myriad of choices about what to feed your pup: store-bought or home- made, premium brand or run-of-the-mill, wet or dry. When nearly every brand on the market claims to be the best, how do you decide? Don’t worry. I’ve done some investigative reporting to get the scoop on just what makes one puppy food different from the rest. Here I explain the ingredients in plain English and then help you decide what the best diet options are for you and your puppy.\n\nAs your puppy ages, they’ll need a different balance of nutrition to keep them healthy. Like humans, older dogs need less protein and fewer calories.\n\nDeciding what to feed your puppy is a major to-do these days. Though all dog food manufacturers are sworn to meet your puppy’s nutritional needs, the amount of food you’ll need to give your puppy in order to meet their minimum daily require- ment ( or MDR) differs greatly: a fact that matters if you’re the one holding the poop bag. The ingredients they use, how they mix it, and even the tricks they use to make it palatable to your precious puppy are what set one diet apart from another. Some pet food companies take great care to use top-of-the-line ingredi- ents that most dogs can easily digest; other companies do not.",

Is their coat shiny and their nose slightly moist? Those are all good signs. Another significant sign is their weight and growth rate: It’s important not to overfeed your puppy, because it throws the nutrients in a well-balanced diet out of whack. Excessive weight or rapid growth spurts, which can be encouraged by overfeeding, can put pressure on their developing joints, bones, and muscles, causing skeletal pressure that may haunt their adulthood.\n\nOne way to judge your puppy’s weight is to feel their spine and rib cage: Though you should be able to feel the last three ribs, their shoulder blades, and their spine, neither element should be protruding.\n\nThere are key differences you need to know about before you can decide which food type is right for your puppy:\n\n» Dry food (kibble) is cheaper and more convenient, but it has more preserva- tives and is less appealing to dogs. Dry kibble requires processing to blend the various ingredients, and its cereal-like consistency is unlike anything a dog would be attracted to in the wild. Dry food uses lots of chemical preservatives to keep it fresh and prolong its shelf life.

But it’s more expensive, and it can grow bacteria and become contaminated relatively quickly, so you shouldn’t leave it out for more than an hour. For dogs with sensitive digestive systems or allergies, wet food can make a huge difference. Canned food also retains more water and uses less cereal-type grains than dry food, which can also dramatically affect your puppy’s processing because few dogs would nosh on rice or wheat stalks if allowed to scavenge for food. The soft, gushy consistency of wet food, as well as its pungent meaty odor, is often more attractive to both dogs and owners.\n\n» Raw food is another option to consider when choosing food for your puppy. A raw-food diet is exactly like what it sounds: a mixture of raw meat, uncooked bones (often pulverized), veggies, fruits, and a few other raw ingredients that strive to mirror the foods a dog/puppy would eat in the wild. Specialty pet stores sell premade raw-food diets, or you can research how to make well-formulated meals right in your kitchen. (Of course, safe storage and careful handling are musts when handling any raw food, so remember to wash those hands!)\n\n» Freeze-dried food is still considered raw food. Should you choose to rehy- drate it for your pup, it will have much the same allure as any other unpro- cessed diet. As the name suggests, the ingredients have been dried at a low temperature until all the moisture is removed, which eliminates the need for chemical preservatives.

Home cooking, like commercial food, allows for a lot of variation, from the types of meats you choose to the extra additives that meet the requirements for vitamins, minerals, and carbohydrates. If your puppy is prone to allergies or has a highly sensitive digestive system, you may want to consider this option seriously. You may end up spending as much or more at the veterinarian and on medication as you would on a high-end diet.\n\nIf you’re considering going this route, make sure you think it through carefully. While feeding your puppy a well-balanced and nutritious diet has many pros, it is a time commitment, especially if you have a special-needs puppy who requires more protein to support their development. Followed responsibly, the home diet can be modified for your puppy’s age, breed distinctions, and individual needs. If you need help with your homemade formula, check out The Holistic Guide for a Healthy Dog, by Wendy Volhard and Kerry Brown (Wiley). Your recipe may call for some tinkering until you get a formula that best suits your puppy’s everyday needs.\n\nWhen buying any dry or wet food, try to get human-grade ingredients (ingredi- ents safe for human consumption). Read the label before you buy. Low-end foods often use by-products, discarded meats, and additives to enhance the smell and color.

The only real similar- ity is in the percentage of components required to meet a dog’s daily allowance, which is determined by the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO). Foods must contain six essential elements: protein, fat, carbohydrates, vitamins, minerals, and water. These elements make up the minimum daily requirement. But that’s where the similarities end.\n\nEven though the requirement is set by law, each company can choose whatever ingredients it wants to fill that requirement. For example, some foods include soy to meet the daily protein requirement, whereas other foods include meat or other animal protein. What’s the big difference between soy and meat? Your puppy will have to eat about four times as much soy to reach their MDR of protein than meat: which amounts to about four times as many calories and one ginormous pile of poop! For dogs, animal protein beats soy hands down.\n\nWhen searching for the right dog food, pay close attention to your dog’s digestion. Foods with low-quality ingredients aren’t absorbed as well and can give your dog loose stools. Good food should help your puppy produce two to four compact, inoffensive-smelling stools a day.\n\nThe following sections discuss each of the essential components in dog food and compare how the various grades of food meet these requirements.\n\nProteins (recommended 21 to 26 percent of the food)\n\nPuppies need protein for their growth and development and their immune system — more so when they’re in their growing phases. Your puppy’s food should be between 21 and 26 percent protein in makeup. (You can find out how much is in the food by looking at the label on the back of the packaging.)",

If your puppy leads a more sedentary existence or you’ve restricted exercise due to a recommendation or injury, speak to your veterinarian about reducing the ratio of protein in your puppy’s diet.\n\nMore protein isn’t always better. High-protein diets are used for show or working dogs.

When you read the label, you see one or more protein sources: meat, animal, or grain protein. Here’s the translation:\n\n» Meat protein: Meat protein consists of organ meat or muscle meat. This type of protein is the closest to human quality and is superior to other protein sources.\n\n» Animal by-products: Animal by-products consist of any part of the animal that contains protein — hair, hooves, lips, and eyelashes are included in this group.\n\n» Vegetable or grain proteins: Anything that includes the word gluten can",

Even though a dog doesn’t know the difference between lactose and lactose-free, their stomach sure does — lactose in dogs produces gas and loose stool.\n\nHere are some tidbits to keep in mind when researching fats in your puppy’s diet:\n\n» Many food companies have begun adding tallow fat to meet the minimum daily requirement. Used in the production of candles, this fat is inexpensive and indigestible. When a brand claims a “new formula,” make sure the change doesn’t include this unusable ingredient.\n\n» Supplementing fat in your puppy’s diet is often unnecessary. However, if your vet encourages you to increase fat content, use pressed safflower oil drizzled over their meal, approximately one teaspoon for small dogs and one table- spoon for large dogs. This oil has a high concentration of linoleic acid and is least likely to cause an allergic reaction.",

Note the ingredients to stay away from.\n\nTake a minute to read the ingredients listed in Figure 17-1. Compare the protein and carbohydrate sources, and then focus on fats — animal fat is a generic term for a class of inexpensive fats. Chicken fat and sunflower oil are better alterna- tives. Again, if you’re unsure, ask your vet for advice.\n\nSome people would say that the high-quality foods cost more, but that’s arguable. Consider that you have to feed your puppy more to get the daily requirements; when you factor in the health concerns, you may end up saving more money in the long term by feeding your puppy a healthier diet.

Hypoallergenic diets use novel protein and carbohydrate sources that your puppy hasn’t been exposed to.

For more on grooming as your pup grows up, check out Dog Grooming For Dummies, by Margaret H.

When puppies feel pain, stress, or entrapment, they may withdraw, react defensively to touch, or vocalize loudly in the form of a whimper, yelp, or growl. It’s your job to be their interpreter. Establishing routine daily checkups not only conditions your puppy to handling but also keeps you aware of anything that may be running amiss.\n\nThink you’ve got chutzpah to groom your puppy yourself? You just might, but before you start drawing the bathwater, consider all that’s involved in keeping your puppy clean, brushed out, and coiffed.\n\nTime and patience: Depending on your puppy’s coat type, the adult length, and whether their hair grows or sheds, getting into a routine of daily brushing and monthly or bimonthly bath times to keep your puppy free of knots and tangles is a must.\n\nThe right equipment: Will your puppy need periodic clips?

Perform no clipping at this step.\n\n2. Swipe some peanut butter (or a similar paste) across the refrigerator at your\n\ndog’s eye level. As they lick, rub their paws with the clipper.\n\nDon’t cut the nails just yet. Open and shut the clippers to acquaint them with the sound.\n\n3. Gradually manipulate your puppy’s paw to get them acquainted with having\n\ntheir paw held against their will for more than 3 seconds.\n\nTo do this, determine the best pose for you to clip your puppy’s nails. Will you have them stand with their paw on your knee, or do you want them sitting while you hold their paw gently in one hand and clip with the other. I tell my clients to face in the same direction as their puppy, rather than facing them as many puppies view that pose as threatening.",

Gradually increase the time, always rewarding them with a high value treat after they cooperate with the exercise.\n\nIf your puppy holds nicely still for up to 4 seconds but starts to squirm after 6 sec- onds, don’t reward the squirming. Dial it back to where your puppy was successful and reward that stage. Gradually — very gradually — inch back up to 6 seconds, even if you have to increase the hold one millisecond at a time!\n\n5. Once your puppy will sit still while you handle their paws for up to 10 seconds, try one cut — just one — by placing the edge of the clippers over the top of the nail and quickly squeezing the handle. Clear nails are easier to cut as you can literally see where the pink quick of the tip begins. If your puppy has dark nails, you need to take extra precaution. You can ask your veterinarian or groomer to give you a lesson.\n\nNote: Don’t correct your dog if they protest. Be understanding and slow down. Consider the alternative — filing instead of clipping. Again, nail clipping sounds like a major production, but in the long run, you’ll be glad you took the time to do it right. Anyone who has cut their dog or frightened them by being too rough can tell you that having a clipper-phobic dog is a nightmare.\n\nSoulful, sweet, comic — your puppy’s eyes express it all.

Note that a resting dog’s temperature is between 100.5 degrees and 102.5 degrees, which is much warmer than the normal 98.6 degrees for humans. A good idea is to take your puppy’s temperature when they’re well so that you can gauge an illness when symptoms show.\n\nPuppies, like kids, need vaccinations and regular checkups. Get out your appoint- ment book and schedule regular visits to ensure that your puppy gets all the pro- tection they need.\n\nA puppy’s first vaccines should be given as they’re weaned off their mother’s milk. Unless a puppy is orphaned, which would require more medical interven- tion, that usually means a puppy’s first vaccine should begin at six weeks.

Before you look up that word, let me cut to the chase. People are diur- nal: We’re awake two-thirds of the day. Some animals are nocturnal: They’re awake at night. Dogs are crepuscular: They’re most awake at dawn and dusk, and they sleep for 75 percent of a 24-hour cycle. This is great news if you hop on the sleep training routines listed in Chapter 7, but it’s bad news if you’re already overstimulating your puppy with constant activity. If you’ve been duped into thinking that your dog needs entertainment when you can’t be with them, you likely have a puppy who is chronically sleep deprived. And how will you know?

The good news? Many of these diseases are preventable with vaccinations. In this section, I detail the many vaccines that your veterinar- ian will recommend. Core vaccines are considered essential because the diseases they prevent are common and highly contagious — and have a mortality rate. Other vaccines may be a good idea too, depending on where you live and what your puppy is exposed to. Speak to your veterinarian about what they recommend.\n\nWhen your puppy gets vaccinated, your vet injects antigens, or small amounts of the disease itself, into your puppy’s vein or muscle. When the antigens are intro- duced, they act like a tiny army of invaders — two or three little disease soldiers. Instantly, your puppy’s internal defenders — the good soldiers — set out to destroy the invaders. The good soldiers win easily because so few antigens are present. Most puppies can conquer the invaders without developing any symp- toms. This internal battle of good-versus-evil helps your puppy develop a fleet of protectors called antibodies. These newly enlisted antibodies stand at the ready to shield your puppy if the disease reappears. The same holds true with human vaccines.\n\nCore vaccines prevent diseases that have a high mortality rate and are widespread in the United States. All puppies must get these vaccines or be at great risk of contracting and passing on deadly viruses. These inoculations are routinely given at 6, 12, and 16 weeks of age.",

Symptoms include vomiting, increasingly severe diarrhea (yellow to\n\nyellow-gray and then tinged with blood), and overall depression. Although there’s no medical “cure,” early supportive care is essential to a puppy’s survival. Your veterinarian will recommend that you keep the puppy still and well-hydrated and offer you the option of leaving your puppy in their care until the worst symptoms have passed.",

Distemper is tricky to diagnose because the symptoms appear in stages. At first, a puppy may have a fever and loss of appetite, and then they may appear fine and healthy as the disease incubates for six to nine days. Stronger symptoms appear a week or more later, including eye and nose discharge, coughing, vomit- ing, diarrhea, walking and balance issues, and seizures. If the puppy is unable to fight off the disease, it often causes brain swelling and can lead to death.\n\nCanine hepatitis, a type of adenovirus, is a disease of the liver with symptoms sim- ilar to human hepatitis (though not transmittable to humans), and it can cause death. Symptoms include fever, an enlarged liver, and coughing. Passed through stools and urine, this highly contagious disease gets lodged in the tonsils and can cause respiratory tract illnesses as well.\n\nThis deadly viral disease is transmitted through the saliva and bite wounds inflicted by infected animals. Rabid animals are often compelled to bite their vic- tims, people included — sounds like a bad vampire movie, but you won’t get a happy ending here. The disease enters the body, moves to the brain where it incu- bates for a month or two, and then causes disorientation, fever, personality changes (increased aggression and biting tendencies), and seizures. In its final stages, the infected animal enters a paralytic stage, can’t move its head or neck, froths at the mouth (because it can’t swallow), and dies a horrid, suffering death.

Both wild and domestic mammals can transmit the dis- ease through contact with urine and stagnant water. Symptoms include vomiting, fever, weight loss, and overall pain and discomfort, and it’s easy to diagnosis through a blood sample.\n\nTreatment involves a round of penicillin or antibiotics to help your puppy rid their system of the bacteria.

Speak to your veterinarian about the prevalence of leptospirosis in your area to find out whether the vaccine is a good idea for your pup.\n\nLyme, a tickborne bacterial disease, attacks a puppy’s nervous system and causes a whole host of ailments that should trigger suspicion, including lameness, swol- len joints and lymph glands, loss of appetite, lethargy, and aggression.

(The most common infection is caused by the Bordetella virus — the kennel cough virus — but luckily enough there’s a vaccine that can render your pup immune to the disease.). In the most serious cases, a cough can signal heartworm or distemper, especially in young dogs who aren’t fully vaccinated.

If you notice lethargy, a sudden drop in your puppy’s pep — for example, they can barely get up to greet you or show little enthusiasm for treats, walks, or adventures — it may indicate a more serious problem. Look for other signs, such as fever, diar- rhea, and respiratory issues. If your dog’s lack of energy persists for more than a day or two, call their doctor. Although many puppies may display these symptoms when they experience the sudden emergence of hormones, a drop in energy level is often the first sign of internal upset.\n\nDiarrhea is a common ailment in puppies, and when unaccompanied by other symptoms, it usually signals a reaction to dietary changes or stress (from the drama of a move or abandonment to even the simplest change in schedule).

If your puppy starts to itch and itch and itch, however, especially in the same place, it might do you well to take note. Dry skin can signal an allergy, a cut or scrape, or a parasitic invasion (fleas, mites, roundworm, and the like). Occasionally, an itch can even signal something worse.

If traveling alone, bring a mirror. Ticks can latch on at any level — they fall from trees, attach to the undergrowth, and crawl on the ground. How delightful!\n\n» Wear protective clothing.

With topical spot treatments, you put a drop of\n\nthe product on the puppy’s skin; the repellent moves through the pup’s oil glands and hair follicles to cover the whole body.\n\nIf you prefer a spray repellent to a topical one, remember not to spray repellent around your puppy’s eyes. To treat their forehead and ears, place the product on a glove and massage it into those hard-to-reach areas. Don’t forget the paws.\n\nStore-bought tick products are toxic; placement is important to prevent your puppy from licking their body after treatment. If they’re tempted, occupy them with their favorite game until the product dries.\n\nFunnily enough (I guess), ringworm isn’t a worm — it’s a fungus. Round and irritating, this parasite feasts on the outermost layer of skin, on nails, and on hair follicles and is prevalent the world over. While most adult dogs develop a natural immunity to ringworm, it isn’t uncommon in young puppies. Though not fatal, it’s contagious through direct, skin-to-skin contact (dog-to-dog, dog-to-human, dog-to-whatever-living-thing) — and even through contact with objects or sur- faces that an infected person or animal has recently touched or rubbed against. Symptoms do not include itching in most pets, but can be recognized by circular, hairless patches or crusty areas of hair loss throughout the body.",

Before treating for these parasites, make sure you get a diagnosis from your vet to ensure that the treat- ment is parasite-specific. (Infections can cause some of the same symptoms.) Read on to find out what symptoms may indicate mites or mange.\n\nEar mites crawl into your puppy’s skin to reproduce. These eight-legged buggers nestle in your dog’s ear and feed on the outer layer of skin. The first sign of ear mites is your puppy’s behavior — they’ll scratch their ear intently, shake their head, and walk funny.\n\nYou can check for ear mites by examining your dog’s ear canal. If the canal is filled with brown wax and is crusty around the edge, take your pup to the vet. Your veterinarian can determine whether mites (or another sort of infection) are the problem and can quickly get your pup on the road to recovery. After your puppy\n\ngets a professional flushing from their doctor, you need to follow up with drops and cleaning procedures.\n\nMange mites are nasty little creatures that are related to ear mites. However, they’re more free-ranging than ear mites and often localize along the spine, legs, head, or underside of your puppy’s body. Here are the three different types of mange mites (talk to your vet for a diagnosis and treatment):\n\n» Cheyletiella, or walking dandruff: These critters hang out along your puppy’s spine and create a lot of flaking as they munch on their skin. The surest sign is intense scratching and nibble-biting along the spine.",

Under normal conditions, these mites coexist at a harmonious level with dogs. However, if a puppy gets stressed or is malnourished, they can multiply and create either a localized infection (the infected area loses hair and becomes itchy, red, and bald) or a widespread infection (creating large, inflamed, bald patches).\n\n» Sarcoptic mange: Otherwise known as scabies, these contagious crab-shaped bugs burrow into your puppy’s skin to lay eggs and sip blood. Their favorite spots are the head, legs, and underside. The surest sign is a puppy who literally can’t stop itching all over.\n\nAs much as you may want to control your pup’s itch with anti-inflammatories, don’t. Anti-inflammatory drugs, such as cortisone, lower an already weakened immune system.\n\nInternal parasites are much more of a health hazard to dogs than external para- sites are. Internal parasites are especially dangerous to puppies because they can really mess with the pup’s developing systems and can deplete the necessary bal- ance of nutrients.\n\nThe nasty heartworm is transmitted by mosquitoes (and therefore is more preva- lent in warmer climates) and lives in the chambers of the heart and in the lungs.\n\nLeft untreated, heartworm disease is fatal.

Puppies either pick up hookworms by eating an infected animal’s feces, or by nursing on their infected mom, or coming in contact with worms that creep through their tender skin. Symptoms include bloating, excessive gas, loose and smelly stools, weight loss with a failure to gain weight despite a large appetite, bloody stools, a dry and brittle coat, and even severe anemia and death.\n\n» Roundworms: This type of parasite floats inside a dog’s body — in the liver, through the heart, and in the lungs. In their final stage, roundworms settle in the small intestine, where they feast on what’s left of your dog’s dinner. Many dogs who have a case of roundworms are plagued with an insatiable appetite or no appetite and vomiting, smelly diarrhea, gas, and bloating.

Thinking out a few steps ahead and knowing your puppy’s personality and passions can stop a lot of incidents before they happen. Is your puppy a wire chewer? Tape them up or coat them with a distasteful spray such as bitter apple or oregano oil. Do you have a runner? Having a dog that likes to venture out into the world beyond can be scary for those left behind. First step: Get your puppy fixed — if procreation is on their mind, away they will roam. (For more on spaying and neutering, see Chapter 18.) You’ll also need to invest in off-leash training, trips to the dog park, or a fence. (See the later section “Fences Help” for enclosure options.) Is your puppy intent on ingesting interesting items — food items and otherwise? Keeping your house tidy can help, but having a first aid kit on hand and the poison control hotline in your contacts list is a must.\n\nPlan and collect items you may need in an emergency.

Sure, it looks hideous to you, but wearing a muzzle at some point in their lives may be a necessary option., and a willing- ness to wear one may help them get the medical care they need.

Practice holding gauze on an imaginary wound as you talk in a calming voice. Hold the pad on for three seconds, release, and then offer a treat. Continue to increase the holding time, and always reward your dog after you let go in order to reward their cooperation.\n\n» Pretend eye applications: When dogs feel uncomfortable, they squirm. To\n\nget yours used to having their face and eyes managed, have a friend lure your puppy with a treat or chew. Touch the dropper to your puppy’s cheek, at least 2” from their eye.

Fenced enclosures allow your dog to have freedom versus constantly keeping them leashed or putting them on a tie-out. Both restrict your dog unnaturally and may cause injury or death if affixed to their tender neck. If possible, include your home, also known as your dog’s den, within the fenced area, versus placing the pen in a distant portion of the yard — all dogs prefer to be close to the den when resting or eating.\n\nYour puppy is a social creature and may not want to stay outside alone until they’re older and more confident. Be creative when decorating your dog’s play yard. Use jumps and tunnels, swinging objects, toys, bones, and puzzle feeders to direct your puppy’s attention when you play together.\n\n» Physical barriers: These above-ground fences are considered by most\n\n(including myself) to be the most humane because they don’t require that your dog wear a battery-operated collar that shocks your dog when they cross the flagged barrier.\n\nThe variety of physical fences includes picket, chain-link, and split rail.\n\nOne drawback to physical fences is that gates may be left ajar and your dog may wander.

Add that state of mind to your puppy’s natural tem- perament and what you get is a fairly unpredictable reaction.

If you’re not around or you don’t react quickly, choking can be fatal. One way to prevent choking in the first place is to think smart: Don’t give your puppy toys that are smaller than the width of their muzzle, and remove any bones once they can fit inside your puppy’s mouth.\n\nIf your puppy chokes on something, stay calm and focused while following these steps:\n\n1.

Twice a day, wipe the area with hydrogen peroxide to keep it safe from infection, and it should heal just fine.\n\n» A continuous or oozing stream: This type of bleeding requires medical\n\nattention immediately. Raise the body part above the heart, if possible, and apply bandages, one on top of the other, to soak up the blood as you press down on the area to slow the flow.",

Place bandage on top of bandage, elevate the limb (if possible), and put constant pressure on their wound. Drive to the nearest animal hospital.\n\nIf you suspect internal bleeding, get your puppy to a hospital immediately. Inter- nal bleeding is a life-threatening situation. White gums, a distended abdomen, a bloody cough, or vomiting spells indicate internal bleeding.\n\nFind your puppy’s pressure points. While they’re sleeping, feel for the pulse near the hip and elbow joints. These arteries regulate blood flow and, in an emergency, you can press them to slow it down. You can also use ice packs to slow the flow of blood from oozing cuts and scrapes.\n\nMost bug bites are no more of an annoyance for a dog than they are for humans. A bump or scratch or a bit of swelling won’t alter the day too dramatically. How- ever, if a dog is allergic to the bite or sting, the reaction can be severe or even life-threatening. Symptoms of an allergy include facial swelling, hives, fever, joint pain, muscle ache, swelling, vomiting, and diarrhea. If your puppy has this reaction, seek medical attention immediately.\n\nA severely allergic dog goes into respiratory failure, which can be fatal within minutes. This reaction, anaphylaxis, requires immediate veterinary attention. If you know that your puppy is sensitive to insect bites, ask your veterinarian to pre- scribe a bee-sting kit that can counteract the reaction in an emergency.",

Do whatever the veterinarian may suggest, such as pouring cool water over the area before you arrive.\n\nIf your puppy gets burned by chewing on electrical cords and is in pain, apply ice to the burns and give them ice water.

Dogs can suffer from heat- stroke if left in poorly ventilated areas, such as a car or kennel, or if tired out or over-exercised on a humid day. If you notice that your puppy has shallow breath- ing, a rapid heart rate, and a high temperature, cool your puppy gradually with wet towels, a cool bath, or ice around their neck, head, and groin. Take them to the veterinarian if signs persist or worsen.\n\nHeatstroke is preventable. Never leave your puppy in a poorly ventilated environ- ment, and make sure water is always available on warm days. If an emergency necessitates leaving your puppy in the car, contain them in a kennel or seat-belt harness and leave the car running with the air conditioning on and doors locked. For cases like these, keep an extra set of keys in the glove compartment to take with you so that you can get back into your locked car.\n\nThe best solution is never to take your puppy with you on hot days. A car, even with all the windows down, can overheat within an hour — what a horrible way for a dog to die — locked in a hot automobile, just wanting, and waiting for, their caretaker to return.\n\nWalk (or, better yet, crawl) around your house and look at it from your puppy’s perspective.

The damage can range from a sharp to lethal shock or a mild to third-degree burn. If you notice a severed cord, check your puppy’s mouth for burns (and then see “Treating burns,” earlier in this chapter).\n\nFor a list of all household dangers as well as poisonous plants and environmental concerns, you can search on line or download and print a free list from my website (Sarahsayspets.com).\n\nSome puppies love to swallow what they chew — especially if you’re trying to take the object away from them forcefully. The problem is that not all items can pass through a puppy’s intestines. Some get stuck inside, initially causing vomiting, gagging, dry heaves, or coughing, which can go on for days. If that’s not cause enough for alarm, the puppy’s loss of appetite is. If the intestine is blocked and nothing is done to remove the obstruction, the intestine ruptures, which can be fatal.\n\nTreatment depends on how soon you get your puppy to the vet, because you often don’t know whether the object is sharp or could break (thereby rupturing the intestines), whether it’s small and likely to pass, or whether it’s large enough to block digestion. Unless your veterinarian can induce your puppy to vomit up the object (which they may or may not be willing to do to guard your dog’s safety), an X-ray is needed to identify what was swallowed. To remove the foreign object, the doctor may order surgery.",

Think back to your childhood: What are some of your fondest memories? Most everyone learns their most important life lessons — like how to share, use patience, and speak respectfully — in preschool or by playing sports and games with friends and family. Your puppy can learn patience and self-control through play, starting as young as eight weeks old.\n\nIn this chapter, you’ll find ten-plus games that are as fun to play as they are edu- cational. Watch as your puppy’s self-control and focus develop right in front of your eyes. Using directions like Wait, Sit, Down, and Come, you’ll play/train quick responses before your puppy has even lost their baby teeth.\n\nPuppies love to play Chase, but you’ll notice a theme in the games I describe in this chapter: Always encourage your puppy to chase you, not the other way around. Teaching your puppy to follow you and to drop an item they’re holding for the toy or treat you’re holding is an important habit to instill in a young puppy. Consider the opposite: a puppy who runs when you need them to come or who races off with a forbidden treasure, like your cellphone or one of the kids’ toys. Let me help you avoid that habit. Embedded in my description of the games in this chapter is the term “Can’t catch me,” which is a fun way to alert your puppy when you need to get their attention.\n\nThe Find It game is my dogs’ favorite activity. Anyone can play it (even strangers) to help your puppy’s mood, no matter what’s going on around them. Although I mention this game throughout the book, you can start teaching it anytime.",

If you have an anxious puppy, Find It can infuse stressful situations with a fistful of fun!\n\nDirections: Pair Find It with Come, Follow, or Give to teach a quick, happy response and to reward quick responses to other directions, like Sit and On Your Mat.\n\nTo play: Begin by tossing one treat or kibble on the floor by your puppy’s toes as you say “Find it!” After your puppy catches on, toss the kibble by your own toes. Got that? Now take gradually bigger steps away from your puppy as you say “Find it — Follow.” Eventually, Follow will help your puppy keep up with you and stay close by your feet. When your puppy has the gist of it, you can expand the game, by tossing kibbles on the ground for them to forage or by using this game to dis- tract your puppy during greetings and other distractions. For more ideas, flip to the index: You’ll find Find It there, for sure.\n\nForaging mats are now marketed for dogs, designed to hide away a puppy’s entire meal in the cracks and crevices of a durable rug that your puppy can root about in yet cannot destroy. The mat is a great diversion for an active puppy, and you can build in the direction Find It, too. My kids and I love the mats: We spread out a good portion of our dogs’ meals and say “Find it” when we put down their indi- vidualized meal. Be sure to check them out.",

    "page_content": "Overall goal: Tug-of-war is a favorite puppy game that is simple to play, and it just happens to be the best way to teach your puppy to “Give” up an object on cue. Notice as you read how the principles of tug-of-war are used to reward puppies for playing a game they love and how treats can be used to teach your puppy the meaning of the word “Give.”\n\nUse it: Since your puppy will love to tug on anything, with anyone, teach them to Tug only on their toys and only on cue. Through this simple and fun activity, you will build up your puppy’s self-esteem (I guarantee they’ll get this one right) and you’ll have a handy new way to redirect their excitement and frustration. Remem- ber this one rule however, especially when just starting out: Pocket and position treats strategically around your home so that each time you play “Tug” you can also teach your puppy to let go on cue.\n\nDirections: This game has two parts—the Tug and the Give. (See the next sec- tion.) Teach them the words independently of one another for 2 days, then pair them together!\n\nTo play: It’s easy to pair the word “Tug” with the action. Take any of your puppy’s fabric or rope toys, wiggle it until your puppy grabs hold, then say “Tug” as you apply resistance. That’s it. Over time, put a little more umpf into your Tug. Ini- tially, just use a second toy or high value food treat to encourage your puppy’s release. After two days of practicing the Tug and Give separately (as described below) pair them together as instructed.",

If your puppy has something you value in their mouths or an object that may endanger them, “Give” covers all bases. After you make “Give” less of a demand and more of a direction, your puppy will be eager to share their treasures.\n\nPlayers: “Give” can be taught to puppies early on, so puppies of all ages can play this game.\n\nTo play: When your puppy is chewing something, whether appropriate or not, approach them with a treat cup or a handheld treat. Hold the treat near their nose, saying “Give” the moment they release the object. If the object is their toy, how- ever, do not take it — let them keep it. If it’s something they (in your opinion) shouldn’t have, reward them with a jackpot of treats as you remove the object calmly.\n\nIf your puppy runs off with excitement when you approach them, you can practice in a small bathroom to keep them confined. Or, leave a leash on them around the house to enable a calm catch.\n\nRules: If your puppy is growling or clamping the object too tightly, call a profes- sional. Aggression is no joke.\n\nOverall goal: When playing tug-of-war with your puppy remember this: it’s important to let your puppy win at least 2/3rds of the rounds to start. Some people would insist that you’re being weak, but let’s be real. Your puppy is a lot like a 2-year-old child, science says so, and kids feel happier living in a world where play is interactive not domineering.",

Puppies, like kids, have to learn to share. If your puppy ends up at your feet with the toy in their mouth, just ignore them as you play with your object.

Say the phrase, or any other you choose, in your happy voice and — voilà! — a doggie who wags their tail to answer your question.\n\nThe Give a Kiss trick has lots of benefits. Use it to teach your puppy how to use their mouth for an activity other than biting, and then spread the love by teaching your puppy to give a kiss — anywhere, anytime.\n\n1. Swipe the back of your hand with a frozen stick of butter. 2. Point to the spot as you say “Give a kiss!” 3. Repeat Step 1 on the opposite hand.",

After practicing this trick three times, try pointing to your hand without buttering it.\n\nNow try asking your puppy to give a kiss to a friend or family member:\n\n1. Swipe someone else’s hand with a frozen stick of butter. 2. Hold their hand in yours and point to the spot as you say “Give a kiss!” 3. Continue to use the butter trick on the next five volunteers, then test it without the butter!.\n\nNearly everyone who contacts me to help them with their puppy has this universal complaint: their puppy’s sub-par greeting manners. The fancy term is transitional stress, but it all boils down to a den issue. Anyone who comes through your door (including you) is entering your puppy’s den — and no matter the personality or breed of your puppy, that’s a big deal! Trouble can start here if anyone gets excited while trying to calm a puppy, but it doesn’t have to go this way. Instead, you can teach your puppy alternative (and more appropriate) ways to share their enthusi- asm. The following sections describe three of my favorite moves — and, yes, they’re also great tricks that you can and should use throughout the day.\n\nPlace a basket of your puppy’s favorite toys or chew bones by their resting area and by your door. Each time you greet and play with your puppy, say “Go get your toy,” and then wait to give them attention until they get hold of it.\n\nIf your puppy is overexcited at the door, stage pretend visits with a close friend or family member, or simply ring the bell as you prompt your puppy to get their toy. Play tug-of-war or pick up another toy and toss it — make a big fuss.",

    "page_content": "When people come in the door for real, have a light freedom line or leash dragging so that you can calmly interfere with any shenanigans by stepping on or redirect- ing your puppy with Go Get Your Toy in their basket. (See Chapter 15 for other tips on jumping.)\n\nThe best thing about the Belly Up greeting move is that dogs can’t jump when they’re sunny-side up. If your puppy loves to roll up for a belly scratch, start to say “Belly up” each time they do. Soon, belly-up will become their new “happy pose.” When greeting your puppy, wait until they’ve calmed down enough to lis- ten to you before kneeling down and encouraging them with Belly Up. Try it with adoring friends and family, before asking your puppy to belly-up to a total stranger.\n\nIf your dog is energetic by nature, their enthusiasm likely spills over to all greet- ings. One classy move is Spin. To teach your puppy to spin, break up ten treats and, starting at your puppy’s nose, draw the treat back toward their tail. Initially reward any attempt to turn around, and then reward half a spin, and then pro- gressively (over four 5-minute lessons) encourage your dog to give you a full circle. After your dog catches on to your vision, you can ask for more than one spin. Now you’re ready to incorporate the move into greeting family and close friends, and then eventually to anyone who comes into your home.\n\nYou can easily shape Spin into Wipe Your Paws, which you can use on any given day — especially if it’s wet and rainy. It’s basically the same move as Spin, so after directing your puppy to the given mat, say “Wipe your paws —spin,” using treats initially to finesse the connection and rewarding your puppy’s cooperation.",

    "page_content": "Teaching your puppy the Paw instruction is easy and fun: Start with your puppy in a Sit or Down position — whichever one makes them most comfortable. Then follow these steps:\n\n1. Show your puppy that you have a treat, and then close the treat into your fist and tap the ground in front of your puppy’s paws.\n\n2. Wait until your puppy touches your tapping treat hand to flip the hand open and reward them.\n\n3. When this paw-touching move happens quickly, hold the treat in the opposite hand as you tap the floor as you did in Step 1.\n\n4. When your puppy hits the now treat-less hand, open your palm to hold the paw gently as you reward your puppy from the other hand. (See Figure 21-1.)\n\n5. Now try to ask for the paw in different locations and from a Sit or Down position.\n\nA puppy can learn many tricks from a single action. With pawing, for example, you can teach your puppy to shake your hand, give you a pumping bump, or give you a high-five.\n\nNow your puppy’s going to learn to high-five. Make sure you’ve perfected Paw from the earlier section “Paw.” Follow these steps:\n\n2. Hold out your hand as though you were prompting a paw, but the moment your puppy lifts a paw, shift your hand so that your fingers point upward. Say “High-five paw!”\n\n3. Lower your hand if your puppy makes an attempt.\n\nMy kids make sure that all our dogs have mastered the Bump. It’s the rage with my clients, too — no matter their age or how many legs they walk on. Your puppy can bump your first with their noise or paw. This lesson is easy and fun!",

Extend your hand on the ground. The moment your puppy paws your fist open it: this may take more time than the nose bump but be patient.\n\nAlternatively, if your puppy has mastered Paw, you can extend your fist, fingers to the sky and say Paw, Bump. Gradually, flip your fingers down so that your puppy is swatting at your fist rather than your fingers. Each time they slap your fist, say “Find it” as the treat drops to the floor.\n\nDon’t let your puppy become treat dependent. As they catch on to bump, phase out rewarding them each time, offering a toy or praise instead.\n\nDoes your puppy love a good stretch? Betcha didn’t know you could turn this one into a trick. Just follow these steps:\n\n1. As your puppy’s stretching, bow toward them and say “Bow!” 2. Praise your puppy like they just invented the puppy biscuit. 3. Initially, you can prompt this move (or ask the kids to) by pretending to be a dog and bow like they do — in fancy circles, this is called mirroring the behavior.\n\nRepeat these steps each time they stretch. Soon you’ll have them bowing on cue.",

    "page_content": "I’ve always thought that the trick Play Dead was a little depressing. It’s clever, though, so I suggest switching the direction to something more creative, like Go to Sleep or Time for Bed, depending on the situation. This trick’s easy if you have a calm puppy, and it’s good practice for high-energy pups. Follow these steps:\n\n1. Give your puppy the Down direction along with a treat. (See Chapter 11 for training.)\n\n2. Draw a treat under your dog’s chin and under their ear, to encourage your puppy to rest on one side.\n\nAvoid staring at your puppy. Staring makes puppies feel nervous or playful. Lure your puppy’s head down or pet your puppy’s cheek soothingly until it’s resting on the ground.\n\n4. Pet them calmly to encourage them to rest their head on the floor. 5. Keep their head in place by stroking it gently while saying “Go to Sleep — Stay” or whatever term you’ve chosen.\n\nAfter your pup cooperates, take your hand off their head slowly. Eventually, stand up. Make sure you do everything gradually, and remind them “Go to Sleep — Stay” as needed. Soon, you’ll be able to drop the Stay instruction.\n\nEverybody loves the Roll Over routine. Some puppies are into it, but others would rather hibernate in Alaska than roll over. Before you force the issue, ask yourself: Does my puppy roll over on their own? Do they shift from side to side with ease? If you answered yes to either of these questions, your pup will likely be excited about this trick. Follow these steps:\n\n1. Get a handful of treats and encourage your puppy into the Down posi- tion. (See Chapter 11 for Down training.)",

Lure your puppy onto one side by scratching their belly or by circling a treat under their nose and beneath their chin, and then around their ear and over the back of their neck. (See Figure 21-2a.)\n\n3. Say “Roll over” as you circle the treat around their nose toward the opposite side of the floor. (See Figure 21-2 b.)\n\nImagine a string tied from the treat to your puppy’s nose. Basically, you’re trying to pull their body over.\n\n4. If they seem to lean into it, praise them and flip their paws over. 5. When they’ve rolled over, treat and praise them (see Figure 21-2c) and encourage them to jump up.\n\nTeaching “Roll over” is as easy as a-b-c.\n\nGood balance is a requirement for the Ask Nicely trick. You’re asking your puppy to tilt back from a sitting position and balance on their hind paws, like the old begging routine. (Unless your puppy is a natural, wait until your puppy is nine months old before you teach this routine. You don’t want to put undue pressure on developing muscles and tissues.) Follow these steps:\n\n1. Break up five to ten of your pup’s favorite treats. 2. Find a carpeted surface for traction in a private room to practice initially. With your pup in a sitting position, place a treat a few centimeters above their nose.\n\n3. Direct “Ask Nicely” as you bring the treat back toward their ears.\n\nIf they tilt back for a split second, treat and praise them. Encourage the slightest effort initially, and then slowly increase your expectations.",

Draw the treat back and catch their chest, letting them lean their spine against your legs. Repeat the direction, teaching them how to balance as you hold and treat them. Don’t forget to praise and reward when your puppy is in position.\n\nFor challenging moves like sitting vertically with their front paws in the air, always release the treat when your puppy is in the pose with two paws off the floor — you don’t want to mistake the moment and praise your pup for giving up. If you’re having trouble capturing the moment, use a clicker — more on how to use a clicker to shape a behavior in Chapter 5.\n\nAll dogs love to jump — over obstacles, up on rocks, onto visitors, and so on. The trick is to teach them what’s okay to jump on and what isn’t. Before you can quash their people-jumping, though, it’s only fair that you give them a good outlet for all their enthusiasm.\n\nCreate the first jump out of a broom laid on top of two rolls of toilet paper. A low jump builds your pup’s confidence and looks less scary.\n\nPuppies younger than a year should not jump at heights above their elbows — too much development is going on under the skin. Forcing high jumps can cause seri- ous developmental damage.\n\n1. Place your puppy on-lead for control. 2. Let them sniff the jump, and show them a couple of times how you jump the obstacle.\n\n3. Give your puppy at least five strides of runway space and say “Over” as you trot toward the jump. Jump ahead of your puppy and cheer them for following you.",

Drop the lead just before the jump to let your puppy take it alone.\n\n5. Slowly fade out your approaching run, but keep saying “Over” as you point to the jump.\n\nOver can also be a game for the kids. Jumps placed in thresholds encourage jump- ing to fetch toys and balls. The kids can set up a course, indoors or out, and jump with the puppy.\n\nPurchase a hula hoop at a local variety store and then follow these steps:\n\n1. Practice Over (in the preceding section) with a jumping pole across a threshold or between two pieces of furniture until your puppy is familiar with the routine.\n\n2. Put your puppy on a short lead, and let them sniff a hoop as you position it in the center of the jumping area. (See Figure 21-3a.)\n\n3. Ask someone to hold the hoop or prop it up securely. Instruct your puppy Over as you run toward the hoop, letting go of the lead as you get close. When your puppy starts cooperating, combine the Through and Over direc- tions as you start for the jump, like this: “Through — over.”\n\n4. Hold the hoop so that it’s even with the height of the original jumping pole and say “Through — over” as they approach.\n\nYour puppy may hesitate because the hoop looks, well, like a hoop, not like a level jump. If they hesitate, walk over to the hoop slowly and allow them to walk through it a couple of times. Use food to encourage them.",
